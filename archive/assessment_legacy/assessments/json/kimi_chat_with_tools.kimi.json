    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe `kimi_chat_with_tools` tool is a thin orchestrator that forwards chat requests to the Kimi provider.  \nIt is **functionally adequate** for single-turn prompts, but the implementation is **riddled with defensive patches, hidden defaults, and ad-hoc normalisations** that make behaviour unpredictable for callers and expensive to evolve.  \nNo systemic safeguards exist for back-pressure, token-cost, or prompt-injection, so the component is **not production-ready** under load or in multi-tenant scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Ambient Configuration Soup\n**Insight:** Eight separate environment variables silently override the caller’s intent (`KIMI_DEFAULT_MODEL`, `KIMI_ENABLE_INTERNET_SEARCH`, `KIMI_CHAT_STREAM_DEFAULT`, `KIMI_CHAT_RETURN_RAW_ONLY`, …).  \n**Evidence:** Lines 28, 98-100, 146, 210, 117.  \n**Impact:** Identical payloads can produce wildly different results across deployments → CI flakes, hard-to-reproduce bugs, security surprises (e.g., web-search suddenly enabled in prod).  \n**Recommendation:** Freeze env-driven overrides; expose an optional `runtime_options` object in the schema so callers opt-in explicitly.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High.\n\n### 2. Hidden Web-Search Injection\n**Insight:** A boolean flag (`use_websearch`) triggers automatic append of `$web_search` tool without surfacing it in the returned payload.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 103-117.  \n**Impact:** Callers cannot audit or cache the final tool list; breaks deterministic LLM evaluations and violates least-surprise.  \n**Recommendation:** Return the *effective* tool list in the response metadata; log injection at INFO level.\n\n### 3. Ad-Hoc Message Normalisation\n**Insight:** Five different coercions (string → user message, dict missing `content` → empty string, non-dict item → `str(item)`, etc.) are applied inside the critical path.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 121-143.  \n**Impact:** Silent data loss (e.g., `{\"role\":\"system\"}` with no `content` becomes `{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"\"}`) → behaviour drift, harder prompt debugging.  \n**Recommendation:** Reject malformed messages with 4xx instead of silently fixing; provide a `/validate` helper endpoint for pre-flight checks.\n\n### 4. No Back-Pressure or Cost Guardrails\n**Insight:** Tool can be invoked with arbitrary message history and `stream=true`; no max-tokens, request-timeout, or spend-limit is enforced.  \n**Evidence:** Entire `execute` method.  \n**Impact:** Single rogue caller can exhaust Kimi quota or fill logs with multi-MB streaming chunks.  \n**Recommendation:** Wrap the provider call with a circuit-breaker (timeout, retry, token-budget) and surface `429`/`504` to the MCP client.\n\n### 5. Thread-Pool Streaming Anti-Pattern\n**Insight:** Streaming is materialised fully in a background thread (`_aio.to_thread`) then re-serialised as one JSON blob, defeating the purpose of streaming.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 149-188.  \n**Impact:** Memory spike proportional to response size; clients still wait until EOS before seeing first byte.  \n**Recommendation:** Either return an MCP `StreamableHttpContent` (if MCP spec supports it) or disable streaming until native async iterators are plumbed through the transport.\n\n### 6. Implicit Provider Fallback\n**Insight:** If the registry lookup fails, a new `KimiModelProvider` is constructed on-the-fly using `KIMI_API_KEY`.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 69-74.  \n**Impact:** Side-steps dependency-injection configuration; API key may be stale or mis-scoped, causing cryptic 401s deep inside the call.  \n**Recommendation:** Make provider resolution strict; fail fast with “model not registered” instead of fallback.\n\n### 7. Brittle Tool & Tool-Choice Parsing\n**Insight:** JSON string tools are swallowed on parse error; non-standard `tool_choice` strings are nulled.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 80-95.  \n**Impact:** Caller believes tools were supplied but they silently disappear → perplexing 400 from Kimi or no tool calls.  \n**Recommendation:** Validate early, return structured error pointing to the offending field.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Add `max_tokens`, `timeout`, `n` (num_choices) to input schema with sane caps.  \n- Log the *effective* request payload (sans key) at DEBUG.  \n- Replace `pydantic_encoder` + `json.loads` round-trip with `completion.model_dump_json()` (one pass, faster).  \n- Freeze env var list in code comments; fail on unknown keys to avoid typos.\n\n---\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1.",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
