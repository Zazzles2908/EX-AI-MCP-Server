    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe `listmodels` tool is a read-only utility that surfaces runtime model availability across four provider categories (Kimi, GLM, OpenRouter, Custom). It is architecturally sound for its narrow purpose, but the implementation couples presentation logic to provider internals, performs redundant I/O and registry walks, and hard-codes provider metadata. These choices create a brittle surface that will drift as new providers or model metadata are added, and they expose the CLI to latency spikes when OpenRouter’s endpoint is slow or large.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Tight Coupling Between Presentation and Provider Internals\n**Insight:** The tool directly imports provider-specific classes (`ProviderType`, `ModelProviderRegistry`, `OpenRouterModelRegistry`) and reaches into their private data structures (`get_model_configurations()`, `list_models()`, `resolve()`).  \n**Evidence:** Lines 87-89, 169-173, 241-246.  \n**Impact:** Any rename or signature change in the provider layer breaks this tool; new providers require code changes here rather than pure configuration.  \n**Recommendation:** Introduce a thin, stable “ModelCatalog” port (interface) that every provider implements. `listmodels` should depend only on that port; adapters convert provider internals to the catalog DTO.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High\n\n### 2. Redundant & Unbounded Registry Traversal\n**Insight:** The code walks the entire OpenRouter registry twice (once via `provider.list_models`, once via `registry.list_aliases`) and materialises every model name into memory. With OpenRouter’s ~400+ models this is harmless today, but growth or a slow network call blocks the CLI.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 172, 177-191, 244-247.  \n**Impact:** Latency variability; memory footprint grows with catalog size; impossible to paginate or filter later.  \n**Recommendation:** Stream models through a generator and apply server-side filtering (already supported by `respect_restrictions=True`) instead of client-side grouping.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 3. Hard-Coded Provider Metadata Map\n**Insight:** `provider_info` (lines 94-97) is a static dict keyed by enum values. Adding a fifth provider means editing this file, violating OCP.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 94-97, 105, 150.  \n**Impact:** Onboarding new providers requires touching utility code, increasing review surface and merge conflicts.  \n**Recommendation:** Move friendly name and env-key into each provider’s registration record; let the catalog port (see #1) expose them.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High\n\n### 4. Mixed Formatting & Localisation Concerns Inside Core Logic\n**Insight:** Markdown formatting, emoji choice, and human-readable context strings (lines 118-123, 128-137) are embedded in the executor.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 91-302.  \n**Impact:** UI changes require redeploying core logic; impossible to reuse the same data for JSON/API consumers.  \n**Recommendation:** Separate “data” and “view” layers: return a structured DTO (provider→models→meta) and plug in formatters (Markdown, JSON, HTML).  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / Medium\n\n### 5. Hidden Failure Modes for Partial Outages\n**Insight:** Any exception during OpenRouter or Custom model enumeration is caught, logged, and surfaced as a one-line string (lines 222-223, 257-258). Users cannot distinguish “no models” from “service down”.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 222, 257.  \n**Impact:** Silent degradation; support tickets when models disappear.  \n**Recommendation:** Return a structured error flag (`partial_failure=True`) and let the formatter display a warning box; emit metrics for observability.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Cache the result of `OpenRouterModelRegistry().list_aliases()` for the lifetime of the CLI command (seconds) to avoid double walks.  \n- Replace magic strings (`\"Ultra-fast\"`, `\"EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE\"`) with an enum or capability tags supplied by the provider.  \n- Add a `--format=json` flag tomorrow by extracting the data structure before line 302; zero breaking change.  \n- Log the elapsed time for provider calls to spot latency regressions early.\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. Publish a stable “ModelCatalog” service interface; make `listmodels` the first consumer, then migrate chat/completion tools to reuse it.  \n2. Introduce server-side streaming pagination so the CLI can display models incrementally when catalogs exceed terminal height.  \n3. Add telemetry events (`model.list.shown`, `model.list.error`) to drive usage analytics and provider health dashboards.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Refactor to a ModelCatalog",
