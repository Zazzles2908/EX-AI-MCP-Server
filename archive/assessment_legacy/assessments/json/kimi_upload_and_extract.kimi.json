    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe `kimi_upload_and_extract` tool is a single-purpose bridge between local files and Moonshot’s Kimi Files API.  \nIt is built on a clean, pluggable MCP tool base, adds local SHA-based caching to avoid re-uploads, and surfaces extracted text as system messages.  \nHowever, the implementation mixes I/O, retry, caching, and observability concerns inside one 170-line method, relies on hard-coded env-vars for tuning, and exposes no back-pressure or progress feedback to callers. These factors make the component brittle under concurrent load, hard to test, and risky for large-file or high-throughput scenarios.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Monolithic _run Method\n**Insight:** All side-effects (file I/O, upload, retry-loop, cache write, metrics emission) live in one synchronous function.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 66-171—no helper smaller than 20 LOC.  \n**Impact:** Unit tests must mock the provider, cache, observability and filesystem; changes in any layer trigger re-testing everything.  \n**Recommendation:** Split into `hash_and_cache()`, `upload_if_missing()`, `fetch_with_retry()`, `emit_metrics()`; keep `_run()` as orchestrator only.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High\n\n### 2. Hidden, Untuned Retry Policy\n**Insight:** Retry count/backoff is read from env-vars with fall-backs, but no jitter, exponential cap, or logging.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 135-153; sleeps block thread pool (via `asyncio.to_thread`).  \n**Impact:** Thundering-retry bursts when many files fail (e.g., 429) can worsen provider load and lengthen tail latency.  \n**Recommendation:** Replace inline loop with `tenacity` or equivalent—add jitter, max-time budget, structured logs.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 3. Cache Key Collision & Eviction Gap\n**Insight:** Cache key is SHA-256 only; no inclusion of `purpose`, model version, or upload options.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 95, 121.  \n**Impact:** Same file uploaded with different `purpose` re-uses cached ID, potentially returning wrong parsed text.  \n**Recommendation:** Extend cache key: `sha256[:16]:purpose`; add TTL or size-based eviction policy.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High\n\n### 4. Lack of Streaming / Progress Feedback\n**Insight:** Tool is async but still materialises full file text in memory and returns a single JSON blob.  \n**Evidence:** Line 177 dumps entire `msgs` array.  \n**Impact:** UX freezes for >50 MB files; memory spikes can crash the MCP server.  \n**Recommendation:** Offer optional `\"stream\": true` parameter yielding `TextContent` per file; or paginate returned messages.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High\n\n### 5. Implicit Thread-Pool Blocking\n**Insight:** `asyncio.to_thread` is used, yet retry sleeps and SHA-256 hashing run on that thread.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 176, 147.  \n**Impact:** Under concurrent calls the default thread pool (≈8 threads) saturates, blocking the event loop.  \n**Recommendation:** Use `aiofiles` for hashing, and `anyio` task-group with semaphore for concurrency cap.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / Medium\n\n### 6. Over-Privileged Error Swallowing\n**Insight:** All observability and cache writes are wrapped in bare `except Exception: pass`.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 103, 110, 124, 130, 162, 168.  \n**Impact:** Silent failures mask corruption or quota issues; hard to debug in production.  \n**Recommendation:** Log at debug level even when continuing; escalate on critical failures (e.g., cache write fails repeatedly).  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 7. Security: Unvalidated Path & Size\n**Insight:** File paths are used directly; no check for symlink, traversal, or size until provider rejects.  \n**Evidence:** Line 84 uses `str(fp)` straight from user input.  \n**Impact:** Malicious client can upload `/etc/passwd` or 5 GB video, exhausting quota or leaking data.  \n**Recommendation:** Resolve under project root, reject `..`, enforce `KIMI_FILES_MAX_SIZE_MB` locally before upload.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Replace inline retry loop with `tenacity` (≤30 min).  \n- Add `purpose` to cache key; flush cache script for ops (≤1 h).  \n- Validate & normalise file paths with `Path.resolve()` under repo root (≤30 min).  \n- Surface structured logs for cache hit/miss/upload error (≤1 h).  \n- Document",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
