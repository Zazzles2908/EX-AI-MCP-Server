    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe `kimi_chat_with_tools` tool demonstrates solid architectural alignment with MCP standards and provides robust Kimi model integration with flexible tool usage. However, it suffers from significant maintainability risks due to monolithic execution logic, environment variable over-reliance, and complex input normalization. While the streaming implementation and fallback mechanisms show good resilience, the current structure impedes scalability and future extensibility without refactoring.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Monolithic Execution Method\n**Insight:** The `execute` method (lines 67-236) violates single responsibility by handling provider resolution, input normalization, tool injection, streaming, and response formatting in one 170-line block.\n**Evidence:** Method spans 170 lines with distinct logical sections (provider setup at lines 68-74, tool normalization at 76-96, message parsing at 119-143, streaming at 149-188).\n**Impact:** Creates high cognitive load for maintenance, increases regression risk during changes, and hinders unit testing of individual components.\n**Recommendation:** Decompose into focused private methods: `_resolve_provider()`, `_normalize_tools()`, `_parse_messages()`, `_handle_streaming()`, and `_format_response()`.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff.\n\n### 2. Environment Variable Anti-Pattern\n**Insight:** Heavy reliance on environment variables (8+ unique vars) creates hidden dependencies and configuration fragility.\n**Evidence:** Scattered usage across lines 28 (`KIMI_DEFAULT_MODEL`), 69 (model resolution), 99-101 (`KIMI_ENABLE_INTERNET_TOOL`), 146 (`KIMI_CHAT_STREAM_DEFAULT`), 210 (`KIMI_CHAT_RETURN_RAW_ONLY`).\n**Impact:** Reduces testability (requires env mocking), causes runtime surprises when vars change, and complicates deployment configuration.\n**Recommendation:** Introduce a `KimiConfig` dataclass encapsulating all env-derived defaults with validation, injected during tool initialization.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff.\n\n### 3. Brittle Input Normalization\n**Insight:** Complex message normalization logic (lines 120-143) attempts to handle too many edge cases with nested conditionals.\n**Evidence:** Handles string/list/dict inputs with fallbacks like `content = str(item)` (line 140) and `content = \"\"` (line 136), risking data loss.\n**Impact:** High surface area for subtle bugs when handling unexpected input formats, and difficult to extend for new message types.\n**Recommendation:** Implement a dedicated `MessageNormalizer` class using visitor pattern for type-specific handling, with strict schema validation.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, Medium payoff.\n\n### 4. Streaming Implementation Risk\n**Insight:** Streaming logic (lines 149-188) uses thread-blocking `_aio.to_thread` with nested exception handling that could mask errors.\n**Evidence:** Broad `except Exception` (line 173) ignores malformed chunks, and thread execution (line 180) lacks timeout controls.\n**Impact:** Potential for silent failures, resource leaks, or unbounded blocking under provider API issues.\n**Recommendation:** Add explicit timeout handling, structured error logging, and chunk validation before accumulation.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff.\n\n### 5. Tool Injection Coupling\n**Insight:** Web search tool injection (lines 103-118) hardcodes the `$web_search` structure and assumes OpenAI schema.\n**Evidence:** Direct dict creation (lines 105-110) with `\"type\": \"builtin_function\"` and fixed `\"name\": \"$web_search\"`.\n**Impact:** Breaks if Kimi changes tool format, and prevents supporting other built-in tools without code changes.\n**Recommendation:** Abstract tool injection via a provider interface method (e.g., `prov.get_builtin_tools()`) with configuration-driven selection.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff.\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Add timeout parameter to `_aio.to_thread` calls (line 180) to prevent indefinite blocking\n- Replace broad `except Exception` (line 173) with specific error types and logging\n- Extract hardcoded web search tool dict (lines 105-110) into a constant\n- Add input validation for `temperature` (line 160) to prevent provider API errors\n- Implement basic request/response logging at method entry/exit points\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1**: Refactor `execute()` into modular methods and introduce configuration class\n2. **Phase 2**: Implement provider-agnostic tool injection and message normalization\n3. **Phase 3**: Add request caching and rate limiting for scalability\n4. **Phase 4**: Introduce observability hooks (metrics/tracing) for operational monitoring\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Prioritize execute() refactoring**: Break down the monolithic method into focused components to immediately improve maintainability\n2. **Implement configuration class**: Consolidate environment variable handling into a validated configuration object\n3. **Add error resilience**: Enhance streaming error handling and input validation to reduce runtime instability risks\n\nThese changes will transform the tool from a functional but fragile implementation into a maintainable, extensible component aligned with long-term architectural goals while preserving its current feature capabilities.",

You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions.
