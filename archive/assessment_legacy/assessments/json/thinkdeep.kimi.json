    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe ThinkDeep tool is a well-structured workflow system for systematic investigation and deep reasoning. It demonstrates solid architectural patterns with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive state tracking, and extensible design. However, it exhibits signs of over-engineering with excessive configuration options, complex confidence state management, and potential performance bottlenecks in the expert analysis pipeline. The tool's strength lies in its systematic approach to investigation, but its complexity may hinder maintainability and user experience.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Over-Engineered Configuration Complexity\n**Insight:** The tool exposes 15+ configuration parameters with intricate validation rules and state dependencies, creating unnecessary cognitive overhead.\n**Evidence:** Lines 86-133 show confidence levels with 7 distinct states, temperature controls, thinking modes, web search toggles, and focus areas. The `customize_workflow_response` method (lines 224-288) contains nested try-catch blocks for parameter extraction.\n**Impact:** Increases onboarding time, raises error probability, and complicates testing without proportional value gain.\n**Recommendation:** Consolidate to 3-4 core parameters (confidence, focus_areas, context) and derive others intelligently based on use case patterns.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff\n\n### 2. Brittle Confidence State Management\n**Insight:** The confidence system creates circular dependencies where \"certain\" confidence bypasses expert validation, potentially allowing incomplete analyses to be marked as definitive.\n**Evidence:** Lines 291-294 show `should_skip_expert_analysis` returns True for \"certain\" confidence, while lines 92-93 warn against using \"certain\" unless analysis is complete.\n**Impact:** Risk of premature analysis termination and validation gaps in critical decision-making scenarios.\n**Recommendation:** Remove the \"certain\" confidence level entirely; require expert validation for all analyses or implement a minimum step threshold before allowing completion.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff\n\n### 3. Memory Leak Risk in State Accumulation\n**Insight:** The tool accumulates investigation state across steps without apparent cleanup mechanisms, risking memory growth in long-running analyses.\n**Evidence:** Lines 54-66 track all files_checked (including unrelated ones), and the consolidated_findings object appears to accumulate indefinitely across workflow steps.\n**Impact:** Potential memory exhaustion in extended investigations, especially with large codebases.\n**Recommendation:** Implement periodic state pruning, limit history retention to relevant findings only, and add memory usage monitoring.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, Medium payoff\n\n### 4. Inefficient Expert Analysis Triggering\n**Insight:** The expert analysis decision logic is scattered across multiple methods with overlapping responsibilities, creating performance overhead and maintenance complexity.\n**Evidence:** Lines 476-500 show `should_call_expert_analysis` with fallback logic, while lines 290-294 show separate skip logic, and lines 264-275 show completion detection.\n**Impact:** Reduces system responsiveness and increases cognitive load for maintainers.\n**Recommendation:** Centralize expert analysis triggering into a single deterministic method with clear state-based rules.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff\n\n### 5. UX Complexity in Step Guidance\n**Insight:** The step guidance system generates verbose, context-specific messages that may overwhelm users rather than guide them effectively.\n**Evidence:** Lines 535-587 show `get_step_guidance_message` with 7 confidence-based branches plus progress-based additions, creating potentially confusing guidance.\n**Impact:** Users may ignore guidance entirely or make suboptimal decisions due to information overload.\n**Recommendation:** Simplify to 3 guidance levels (early/mid/late stage) with concise, actionable prompts.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Remove the \"certain\" confidence level to eliminate validation bypass risk\n- Consolidate the 7 confidence states to 4 (exploring/low/medium/high)\n- Replace nested try-catch parameter extraction with a single safe getter method\n- Add memory limits to file tracking (max 100 files before cleanup)\n- Simplify step guidance to template-based responses\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1:** Implement configuration profiles (minimal/standard/comprehensive) to reduce parameter surface area\n2. **Phase 2:** Add state persistence and recovery mechanisms for long-running investigations\n3. **Phase 3:** Introduce adaptive thinking modes that automatically adjust based on investigation progress and findings complexity\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate:** Remove \"certain\" confidence level and consolidate confidence states to reduce complexity\n2. **Short-term:** Implement centralized expert analysis triggering and add memory management for state accumulation\n3. **Medium-term:** Create configuration profiles and simplify step guidance system\n\nThe tool's core architecture is sound, but strategic simplification will significantly improve maintainability and user experience while preserving its systematic investigation capabilities.",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
