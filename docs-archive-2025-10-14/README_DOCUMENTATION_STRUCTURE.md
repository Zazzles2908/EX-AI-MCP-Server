## üìã OVERVIEW

This documentation structure was designed following EXAI's architectural consultation (Consultation ID: ce0fe6ba-a9e3-4729-88f2-6567365f1d03) to organize critical architectural documentation separately from general project status.

## üìù DOCUMENTATION GUIDELINES

### When to Create New Documents

1. **Architecture Documents** - For design decisions, patterns, and technical specifications
   - Location: `01_ARCHITECTURE/<component>/`
   - Naming: Descriptive names (e.g., `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`)

2. **Implementation Status** - For tracking progress and blockers
   - Location: `02_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS/`
   - Update existing files rather than creating new ones

3. **Executive Summaries** - For high-level overviews
   - Location: `03_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARIES/`
   - One summary per major component or initiative

### Document Naming Conventions

- Use UPPERCASE for major documents (e.g., `README.md`, `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`)
- Include dates for time-sensitive documents (e.g., `EXAI_CONSULTATION_2025-10-19.md`)
- Use descriptive names that indicate content (e.g., `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`)
- Prefix phase-specific documents with numbers (e.g., `01_PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION.md`)

### Document Structure

All documents should include:
- **Title and metadata** (date, status, priority)
- **Executive summary** (for longer documents)
- **Clear sections** with headers
- **Code examples** where applicable
- **Next steps** or action items
- **Status indicator** (‚úÖ Complete, üîÑ In Progress, ‚è≥ Planned)
