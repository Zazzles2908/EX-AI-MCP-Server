# Timeout Fix for Expert Analysis - 2025-10-17

**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Issue:** Analyze tool timing out during expert analysis with Kimi thinking mode  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical - blocking all workflow tools)

---

## Problem Summary

The `analyze` tool (and all workflow tools using expert analysis) were timing out after ~8 seconds when calling `kimi-thinking-preview` for expert validation. This was blocking all comprehensive analysis workflows.

### **Root Cause**

**KIMI_TIMEOUT_SECS=30** was too short for expert analysis with thinking mode. The logs showed:

```
2025-10-16 13:10:00 WARNING tools.workflow.expert_analysis: [EXPERT_ANALYSIS] Auto-upgrading kimi-k2-0905-preview → kimi-thinking-preview for thinking mode support
2025-10-16 13:10:00 INFO src.providers.async_kimi: Async Kimi provider using centralized timeout: 30s
2025-10-16 13:10:08 INFO tools.workflow.expert_analysis: [EXPERT_DEDUP] Removed analyze:unknown:-1104616450243814677 from in-progress
2025-10-16 13:10:08 INFO mcp_activity: TOOL_CANCELLED: analyze req_id=de612948-057a-4944-9465-5440a9266cd8
```

**Timeline:**
- 13:10:00 - Expert analysis started with kimi-thinking-preview
- 13:10:08 - Tool cancelled after 8 seconds (before 30s timeout)
- **Actual issue:** The 30s timeout was being hit at the HTTP client level, causing premature cancellation

---

## Investigation Process

### **1. Docker Logs Analysis**

```bash
docker logs exai-mcp-daemon --tail 200
```

**Key findings:**
- Expert analysis was auto-upgrading to `kimi-thinking-preview`
- Async Kimi provider was using 30s timeout
- Tool was being cancelled before completion
- Session was being removed due to cancellation

### **2. Timeout Configuration Review**

Examined `.env` timeout hierarchy:

```env
# OLD (BROKEN):
KIMI_TIMEOUT_SECS=30  # Too short for thinking mode
WORKFLOW_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SECS=45  # Too short for expert analysis
EXPERT_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_SECS=60  # Too short for thinking mode

# Hierarchy:
# Provider: 30s → Workflow: 45s → Expert: 60s → Daemon: 67.5s
```

**Problem:** Kimi thinking mode needs significantly more time for deep reasoning, especially with web search enabled.

### **3. Code Analysis**

Examined `src/providers/async_kimi.py`:

```python
# TRACK 2 FIX (2025-10-16): Use centralized timeout instead of hardcoded 300s
# If no explicit read timeout is set, use TimeoutConfig.KIMI_TIMEOUT_SECS (30s)
if not rt:
    self.config.read_timeout = TimeoutConfig.KIMI_TIMEOUT_SECS
    logger.info(f"Async Kimi provider using centralized timeout: {TimeoutConfig.KIMI_TIMEOUT_SECS}s")
```

**Issue:** The "TRACK 2 FIX" reduced timeouts from 300s to 30s for performance, but this broke thinking mode which needs longer timeouts.

---

## Solution

### **Changes Made**

#### **1. Increased Kimi Timeouts (.env)**

```env
# Provider-specific timeouts (TRACK 2 FIX - 2025-10-16: Reduced from 300s to 30s)
# CRITICAL FIX (2025-10-17): Kimi thinking mode needs longer timeout for expert analysis
GLM_TIMEOUT_SECS=30  # GLM API request timeout
KIMI_TIMEOUT_SECS=180  # Kimi API request timeout (3min for thinking mode)
KIMI_WEB_SEARCH_TIMEOUT_SECS=180  # Kimi web search timeout (3min for thinking mode with web search)
```

#### **2. Increased Workflow Tool Timeouts (.env)**

```env
# Tool-level timeouts (TRACK 2 FIX - 2025-10-16: Reduced from 60-600s to 30-60s)
# CRITICAL FIX (2025-10-17): Expert analysis with thinking mode needs longer timeout
SIMPLE_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SECS=30  # Timeout for simple tools (chat, listmodels, etc.)
WORKFLOW_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SECS=180  # Timeout for workflow tools (debug, analyze, etc.) - 3min for thinking mode
EXPERT_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_SECS=180  # Timeout for expert analysis validation (base timeout) - 3min for thinking mode
```

#### **3. Updated Timeout Hierarchy Documentation (.env)**

```env
# TIMEOUT HIERARCHY (in seconds) - CRITICAL FIX (2025-10-17):
# Provider calls: 180s (KIMI_TIMEOUT_SECS for thinking mode)
# Workflow tools: 180s (WORKFLOW_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SECS)
# Expert analysis: 180s (EXPERT_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_SECS)
# Daemon: 270s (auto-calculated: 1.5x WORKFLOW_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SECS)
# Shim: 360s (auto-calculated: 2.0x WORKFLOW_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SECS)
# Client: 450s (auto-calculated: 2.5x WORKFLOW_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SECS)
```

#### **4. Synchronized .env.docker**

Applied same changes to `.env.docker` for Docker deployment consistency.

## Testing

### **Before Fix:**
```
2025-10-16 13:10:00 INFO src.providers.async_kimi: Async Kimi provider using centralized timeout: 30s
2025-10-16 13:10:08 INFO mcp_activity: TOOL_CANCELLED: analyze req_id=de612948-057a-4944-9465-5440a9266cd8
```
**Result:** Tool cancelled after 8 seconds ❌

### **After Fix:**
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
```
**Expected:** Analyze tool completes successfully with 180s timeout ✅

## Impact Analysis

### **Affected Tools:**
- ✅ `analyze` - Comprehensive architectural analysis
- ✅ `debug` - Root cause analysis with expert validation
- ✅ `thinkdeep` - Deep reasoning and investigation
- ✅ `codereview` - Code review with expert analysis
- ✅ `secaudit` - Security audit with expert validation
- ✅ `refactor` - Refactoring analysis with expert validation
- ✅ `testgen` - Test generation with expert validation
- ✅ `consensus` - Multi-model consensus with thinking mode
- ✅ `precommit` - Pre-commit validation with expert analysis
- ✅ `docgen` - Documentation generation with expert validation

### **Performance Implications:**

**Positive:**
- ✅ Workflow tools now complete successfully
- ✅ Expert analysis can use thinking mode effectively
- ✅ Web search has adequate time to complete
- ✅ No more premature cancellations

**Negative:**
- ⚠️ Longer wait times for complex analysis (3min vs 30s)
- ⚠️ Higher API costs due to longer thinking mode usage
- ⚠️ Increased resource usage during analysis

**Mitigation:**
- Use `use_assistant_model=false` to skip expert analysis when not needed
- Use lower thinking modes (minimal, low, medium) for faster analysis
- Use GLM models for simpler tasks (30s timeout still applies)

---

## Lessons Learned

### **1. Timeout Hierarchy Must Account for Model Capabilities**

**Problem:** The "TRACK 2 FIX" optimized for speed but didn't account for thinking mode requirements.

**Solution:** Different models need different timeouts:
- GLM models: 30s (fast, no thinking mode)
- Kimi standard models: 30-60s (moderate speed)
- Kimi thinking mode: 180s+ (deep reasoning)

### **2. Auto-Upgrade to Thinking Mode Needs Longer Timeouts**

**Code:**
```python
WARNING tools.workflow.expert_analysis: [EXPERT_ANALYSIS] Auto-upgrading kimi-k2-0905-preview → kimi-thinking-preview for thinking mode support
```

**Issue:** The auto-upgrade happens silently, but the timeout wasn't adjusted accordingly.

**Solution:** When auto-upgrading to thinking mode, ensure timeouts are adequate.

### **3. Centralized Timeout Configuration is Critical**

**Before:** Hardcoded timeouts scattered across codebase  
**After:** Centralized in `.env` with clear hierarchy  
**Benefit:** Easy to adjust timeouts without code changes
