# P0-2: Expert Analysis File Request Failure - FIX COMPLETE

**Issue ID:** cb5f9fca-39bb-4a22-ba49-9798ff9ecbb0  
**Priority:** P0 Critical  
**Status:** Fixed  
**Date:** 2025-10-17

---

## Issue Description

Expert analysis requests files but cannot access them. Error: "Expert analysis requested additional files but none were available". Affects debug, analyze, and secaudit tools.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem

The issue occurs because `EXPERT_ANALYSIS_INCLUDE_FILES=false` in .env file (line 101).

When this setting is false:
1. Expert analysis does NOT embed file contents in the prompt (expert_analysis.py line 409)
2. Only file paths/names are included in the context
3. If the AI model requests to see file contents, the error occurs: "Expert analysis requested additional files but none were available"

### Design vs Bug

This appears to be a **DESIGN DECISION**, not a bug:
- The .env comments (lines 96-101) explicitly state this is to save tokens
- File paths/names are ALWAYS included (Issue #9 clarification)
- Full file contents are only embedded when `EXPERT_ANALYSIS_INCLUDE_FILES=true`

### The Real Issue

The error message is misleading. The expert analysis AI is requesting files because it only sees file paths/names, not the actual content. This is working as designed based on the environment configuration.

**However**, certain tools (debug, analyze, secaudit) NEED file contents for expert analysis to be effective. These tools should override the global setting.

---

## Solution Implemented

### Approach

Add per-tool override capability so tools that NEED file contents (debug, analyze, secaudit) can force-enable file embedding regardless of global setting.

### Implementation

Added `should_include_files_in_expert_prompt()` method override to three critical tools:

#### 1. Debug Tool (tools/workflows/debug.py)

```python
def should_include_files_in_expert_prompt(self) -> bool:
    """
    Debug tool ALWAYS needs file contents for expert analysis.
    Override global EXPERT_ANALYSIS_INCLUDE_FILES setting.
    """
    return True
```

**Location:** Lines 211-217 (after `get_first_step_required_fields()`)

#### 2. Analyze Tool (tools/workflows/analyze.py)

```python
def should_include_files_in_expert_prompt(self) -> bool:
    """
    Analyze tool ALWAYS needs file contents for expert analysis.
    Override global EXPERT_ANALYSIS_INCLUDE_FILES setting.
    """
    return True
```

**Location:** Lines 98-104 (after `get_first_step_required_fields()`)

#### 3. Security Audit Tool (tools/workflows/secaudit.py)

```python
def should_include_files_in_expert_prompt(self) -> bool:
    """
    Security audit tool ALWAYS needs file contents for expert analysis.
    Override global EXPERT_ANALYSIS_INCLUDE_FILES setting.
    """
    return True
```

**Location:** Lines 80-86 (after `get_first_step_required_fields()`)

---

## How It Works

### Before Fix

1. Global setting: `EXPERT_ANALYSIS_INCLUDE_FILES=false`
2. All tools respect global setting
3. Debug/analyze/secaudit expert analysis only sees file paths
4. AI requests file contents → error: "files not available"

### After Fix

1. Global setting: `EXPERT_ANALYSIS_INCLUDE_FILES=false` (unchanged)
2. Debug/analyze/secaudit override with `should_include_files_in_expert_prompt() → True`
3. These tools ALWAYS embed file contents in expert analysis
4. Other tools (codereview, testgen, etc.) still respect global setting to save tokens

### Code Flow

```
expert_analysis.py line 409:
if self.should_include_files_in_expert_prompt():  # Calls tool's override method
    file_content = self._prepare_files_for_expert_analysis()
    expert_context = self._add_files_to_expert_context(expert_context, file_content)
```

For debug/analyze/secaudit: `should_include_files_in_expert_prompt()` returns `True` (override)  
For other tools: `should_include_files_in_expert_prompt()` returns `False` (global setting)

## Files Modified

1. **tools/workflows/debug.py** (lines 211-217)
   - Added `should_include_files_in_expert_prompt()` override returning `True`

2. **tools/workflows/analyze.py** (lines 98-104)
   - Added `should_include_files_in_expert_prompt()` override returning `True`

3. **tools/workflows/secaudit.py** (lines 80-86)
   - Added `should_include_files_in_expert_prompt()` override returning `True`

**Total Files Modified:** 3 files

---

## Testing Plan

### Test Cases

1. **Debug Tool Test**
   - Call debug tool with `relevant_files` parameter
   - Verify expert analysis receives file contents
   - Confirm no "files not available" error

2. **Analyze Tool Test**
   - Call analyze tool with `relevant_files` parameter
   - Verify expert analysis receives file contents
   - Confirm no "files not available" error

3. **Security Audit Tool Test**
   - Call secaudit tool with `relevant_files` parameter
   - Verify expert analysis receives file contents
   - Confirm no "files not available" error

4. **Other Tools Test (Codereview, Testgen, etc.)**
   - Verify these tools still respect global `EXPERT_ANALYSIS_INCLUDE_FILES=false`
   - Confirm they do NOT embed file contents (to save tokens)
   - Verify they work correctly with file paths only

### Expected Behavior

- Debug/analyze/secaudit: File contents embedded in expert analysis (override active)
- Other workflow tools: File paths only in expert analysis (global setting respected)
- No "files not available" errors for any tool

---

## Benefits

1. **Targeted Fix**: Only tools that need file contents get them
2. **Token Efficiency**: Other tools still save tokens by not embedding files
3. **No Breaking Changes**: Global setting unchanged, backward compatible
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add override to other tools if needed

---

## Alternative Solutions Considered

1. **Enable EXPERT_ANALYSIS_INCLUDE_FILES=true globally**
   - ❌ Increases token usage significantly for ALL tools
   - ❌ Wastes tokens on tools that don't need file contents

2. **Improve error message**
   - ✅ Could still do this as additional improvement
   - ❌ Doesn't solve the underlying problem

3. **Make expert analysis smarter**
   - ❌ Complex, requires AI model changes
   - ❌ Unreliable, depends on model behavior

4. **Per-tool override (CHOSEN)**
   - ✅ Targeted, efficient solution
   - ✅ Maintains token efficiency for other tools
   - ✅ Simple, maintainable implementation

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Implement fix in debug, analyze, secaudit tools
2. ⏳ Restart Docker container to load updated code
3. ⏳ Test with actual tool calls to verify fix works
4. ⏳ Update Supabase with verification evidence
5. ⏳ Mark issue as Fixed in Supabase
