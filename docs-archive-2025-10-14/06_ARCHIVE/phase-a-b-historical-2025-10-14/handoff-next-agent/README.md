## üìã Your Mission

### Current Status: Phase 8 (Documentation Cleanup) In Progress

**Goal:** Complete Phase 8 - Final documentation cleanup

**Remaining Tasks:**
1. ‚úÖ Rename SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-01-08.md ‚Üí SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-10-09.md (DONE)
2. ‚úÖ Update INVESTIGATION_FINDINGS.md dates and findings (DONE)
3. ‚úÖ Update README.md with current status (IN PROGRESS)
4. ‚è≥ Review and update other documentation files
5. ‚è≥ Ensure consistency across all docs
6. ‚è≥ Final commit and completion

**Why Important:**
- Ensures documentation reflects current state
- Removes outdated information
- Provides accurate handoff for next agent

**Start Here:** Continue with Phase 8 tasks

---

### Alternative: Continue with New Features

If Phase 8 is complete, consider:
- Implementing new features
- Testing Phase 5 embeddings (if API access enabled)
- Performance optimizations
- Additional tooling improvements

## üîç Critical Findings Summary (Updated 2025-10-09)

### Finding 1: Placeholder SDK Clients ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **File:** `src/providers/hybrid_platform_manager.py:33`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED in Phase 4
- **Resolution:** SDK clients now properly initialized with actual SDK instances
- **Impact:** System now has proper SDK client connections

### Finding 2: Stub Filter Function ‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINS
- **File:** `src/server/handlers/request_handler_routing.py:83`
- **Issue:** Function always returns None (no filtering)
- **Impact:** LOW - function works as intended (no filtering needed)
- **Action:** Consider renaming or documenting intent

### Finding 3: GLM Embeddings ‚úÖ CODE COMPLETE
- **File:** `src/embeddings/provider.py:87`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ CODE COMPLETE in Phase 5
- **Blocker:** API key doesn't have embeddings access enabled
- **Action:** User needs to enable embeddings in ZhipuAI dashboard

### Finding 5: GLM Web Search ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED in Phase 3
- **Resolution:** Removed DuckDuckGo fallback, using GLM native web search
- **Performance:** 3x faster using z.ai proxy endpoint

## üìö Key Documentation

### Must Read
- `docs/handoff-next-agent/MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_2025-10-09.md` - Complete plan and status
- `docs/handoff-next-agent/PHASE_6_7_COMPLETION_SUMMARY_2025-10-09.md` - Latest updates
- `docs/handoff-next-agent/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-10-09.md` - Historical context
- `docs/handoff-next-agent/INVESTIGATION_FINDINGS.md` - Findings (updated)

### Reference
- `docs/architecture/releases/` - Version-specific docs
- `docs/architecture/core-systems/backbone-xray/` - Deep-dive analysis
- `docs/architecture/core-systems/backbone-xray/ENV_FORENSICS.md` - Why flags are false

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Available

### Analysis Tools
- `backbone_tracer.py` - Python AST-based import analysis
- `trace-component.ps1` - PowerShell pattern matching

### Usage
```bash
# Analyze any component
python backbone_tracer.py singletons
python backbone_tracer.py providers
python backbone_tracer.py request_handler

# PowerShell version
powershell -File trace-component.ps1 singletons
```

---

## ‚úÖ System Health Checks

### Before You Start
```bash
# Identity check (must be True)
python -c "from server import TOOLS; from src.daemon.ws_server import SERVER_TOOLS; print('SAME OBJECT:', TOOLS is SERVER_TOOLS)"

# Tool count (should be 29)
python -c "from server import TOOLS; print('Tool count:', len(TOOLS))"

# Server status
powershell -Command "Get-Content logs/ws_daemon.health.json | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object tool_count,uptime_human"
```

### After Your Changes
```bash
# Run same checks above
# All should still pass

# Run automated tests (if available)
python -m pytest tests/

# Restart server
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ws_start.ps1 -Restart
```

---

## üìù Task Management

### Update Tasks
```python
# Mark current task in progress
update_tasks([{"task_id": "...", "state": "IN_PROGRESS"}])

# Mark task complete
update_tasks([{"task_id": "...", "state": "COMPLETE"}])

# Add new tasks
add_tasks([{"name": "...", "description": "...", "state": "NOT_STARTED"}])
```

## üìû Questions?

If you're unsure about anything:
1. Check the documentation first
2. Review previous agent's findings
3. Ask the user for clarification
4. Document your decision

---

## üéì Context You Have

### High-Level Understanding ‚úÖ
- System architecture (3 core subsystems)
- Entry points and bootstrap flow
- Provider abstraction layer
- Request processing pipeline
- Import relationships and call graphs

### What You DON'T Have ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Individual tool implementations
- Provider internals (Kimi, GLM specific)
- Utility module details
- Function-level dead code analysis

**This is intentional** - previous agent focused on top-down view. You can dive deeper as needed.

2. **Verify Often** - Run forensic checks frequently
3. **Document Everything** - Future you will thank you
4. **Ask Questions** - User is available for clarification
5. **Stay Focused** - Pick one option and stick with it
