## 📁 SRC STRUCTURE

**Location:** [src/](src/)

### Key Documents:

1. **[SRC_FOLDER_DUPLICATION_ANALYSIS.md](src/SRC_FOLDER_DUPLICATION_ANALYSIS.md)**
   - src/conf/ vs src/config/ analysis
   - src/conversation/ vs src/server/conversation/ analysis

**Key Findings:**
- src/conf/ - ORPHANED (delete)
- src/config/ - ORPHANED (delete)
- src/server/conversation/ - EMPTY (delete)
- src/providers/ and src/server/providers/ - DIFFERENT PURPOSES (keep both)
- src/utils/ and utils/ - DIFFERENT PURPOSES (keep both)

### Key Documents:

1. **[TOOLS_FOLDER_STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md](tools/TOOLS_FOLDER_STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md)**
   - tools/workflow/ vs tools/workflows/ analysis
   - tools/streaming/ analysis
   - tools/providers/ analysis

**Key Findings:**
- tools/workflow/ - BASE CLASSES (keep)
- tools/workflows/ - IMPLEMENTATIONS (keep)
- tools/streaming/ - EMPTY (delete)
- tools/providers/ - UNKNOWN (needs investigation)

---

## 🏛️ ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS

### Confirmed Patterns:

1. **Layered Architecture**
   - Layer 1: utils/ (foundation)
   - Layer 2: tools/shared/ (shared base classes)
   - Layer 3: tools/simple/ | tools/workflow/ (tool frameworks)
   - Layer 4: Individual tool implementations

2. **Mixin Composition**
   - ExpertAnalysisMixin (used by all WorkflowTools)
   - FileUploadMixin
   - WebSearchMixin
   - Other specialized mixins

3. **Registry Pattern**
   - Tool discovery and registration
   - Provider registration
   - Model registration

4. **Facade Pattern** (Partial)
   - SimpleTool orchestration
   - Conservative implementation in Phase 2

5. **Strategy Pattern**
   - Provider selection
   - Model selection

6. **Template Method**
   - WorkflowTool step execution

---

## 📊 KEY METRICS

**System Size:**
- 22 top-level directories
- 1,779 total files
- 433 Python files
- 34 large files (>10KB)

**Shared Components:**
- 3 base classes
- 13 mixins
- 10 highly-used utilities

**Architecture Quality:**
- ✅ NO circular dependencies
- ✅ Clean 4-tier architecture
- ✅ 85% match with intended design
- ✅ NO true duplicates

**Orphaned Code:**
- 7 directories/files to delete
- 3 planned systems (monitoring, security, streaming)

## 🎯 CRITICAL INSIGHTS

### For Refactoring:
1. **SimpleTool has 4 subclasses** - Facade Pattern needed for backward compatibility
2. **WorkflowTool has 12 implementations** - ExpertAnalysisMixin critical dependency
3. **Utils has 37 files** - Needs folder structure (file/, conversation/, model/, config/, infrastructure/)
4. **No circular dependencies** - Safe to refactor with proper planning

### For Performance:
1. **File inclusion can cause bloat** - 1,742 files embedded in some cases
2. **Expert analysis can be expensive** - Token bloat issue fixed (99.94% reduction)
3. **Provider selection is critical path** - Affects every request

### For Stability:
1. **Daemon WebSocket connection** - Critical for system operation
2. **Session management** - State management critical
3. **Tool registry initialization** - Must complete successfully
4. **Provider configuration** - Must be correct for system to work
