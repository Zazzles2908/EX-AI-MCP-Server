## üìã PHASE 3 PLANNED TASKS

**NOTE:** Phase 3 tasks are placeholders. Actual tasks will be defined based on:
- Phase 2 Cleanup completion findings
- User priorities and timeline
- Production deployment requirements

### Task 3.1: Code Consolidation (TBD)
**Goal:** Identify and consolidate duplicate code
**Status:** ‚è≥ NOT STARTED
**Prerequisites:** ‚úÖ Phase 2 Cleanup complete

---

### Task 3.2: Simplify Complex Modules (TBD)
**Goal:** Break down overly complex modules
**Status:** ‚è≥ NOT STARTED
**Prerequisites:** ‚úÖ Phase 2 Cleanup complete

---

### Task 3.3: Improve Code Organization (TBD)
**Goal:** Reorganize code for better structure
**Status:** ‚è≥ NOT STARTED
**Prerequisites:** ‚úÖ Phase 2 Cleanup complete

---

### Task 3.4: Fix File Embedding Limits in WorkflowTools ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY

**Goal:** Implement proper file count/size limits for expert analysis file embedding

**Background:**
During Phase 2 Cleanup testing (Task 2.G.4), discovered that 4 WorkflowTools (Analyze, CodeReview, Refactor, SecAudit) hardcode file inclusion and can embed entire projects (1,742 files, 147KB), causing daemon crashes.

**Temporary Fix Applied (WRONG APPROACH):**
- Commented out hardcoded file inclusion in 4 tools for Phase 2 testing
- This was MY MISTAKE - should use .env variable instead

**Proper Fix Required:**
- [ ] Remove temporary comments from 4 tools
- [ ] Ensure tools respect `EXPERT_ANALYSIS_INCLUDE_FILES` env variable
- [ ] Implement file count limit (env: `EXPERT_ANALYSIS_MAX_FILES`)
- [ ] Implement total content limit (env: `EXPERT_ANALYSIS_MAX_CONTENT_KB`)
- [ ] Add smart file selection (relevance-based)
- [ ] Add logging when limits are hit
- [ ] Test with realistic scenarios
- [ ] Document file inclusion requirements per tool

**Files to Fix:**
1. `tools/workflows/analyze.py:323-327`
2. `tools/workflows/codereview.py:307-311`
3. `tools/workflows/refactor.py:313-317`
4. `tools/workflows/secaudit.py:456-460`

**Status:** ‚è≥ NOT STARTED (deferred from Phase 2)
**Priority:** üî¥ HIGH (affects production use of 4 tools)
**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours

---

### Task 3.5: Reduce Technical Debt (TBD)
**Goal:** Address technical debt backlog
**Status:** ‚è≥ NOT STARTED
**Prerequisites:** ‚úÖ Phase 2 Cleanup complete

---

### Task 3.6: Enhance Maintainability (TBD)
**Goal:** Make codebase easier to maintain
**Status:** ‚è≥ NOT STARTED
**Prerequisites:** ‚úÖ Phase 2 Cleanup complete

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

Based on Phase 2 Cleanup findings, here are recommended priorities:

### Priority 1: Fix File Embedding (Task 3.4) üî¥ HIGH
**Why:** Blocks production use of 4 WorkflowTools
**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours
**Impact:** Unblocks WorkflowTools testing and production use

### Priority 2: Consolidate Provider Logic üü° MEDIUM
**Why:** Reduce duplicate code between Kimi and GLM providers
**Estimated Time:** 3-5 days
**Impact:** Improved maintainability, reduced code duplication

### Priority 3: Simplify WebSocket Server üü° MEDIUM
**Why:** Break down ws_server.py (1200 lines) into smaller modules
**Estimated Time:** 5-7 days
**Impact:** Better code organization, easier maintenance

### Priority 4: Improve Error Handling Consistency üü¢ LOW
**Why:** Standardize error handling across tools and providers
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 days
**Impact:** Better debugging, consistent user experience

### Priority 5: Optimize Performance Bottlenecks üü¢ LOW
**Why:** Address performance issues identified in Phase 2
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 days
**Impact:** Faster response times, better resource usage
