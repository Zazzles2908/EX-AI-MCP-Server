## 🔧 BENCHMARK IMPLEMENTATION

### Tools Required:
1. **Python `time` module** - Timing measurements
2. **`psutil`** - Memory and CPU monitoring
3. **Custom benchmark scripts** - Automated testing
4. **Log analysis** - Performance data extraction

### Benchmark Script Structure:
```python
import time
import psutil
import asyncio
from statistics import mean, stdev

class PerformanceBenchmark:
    def __init__(self):
        self.results = {}
    
    async def benchmark_file_upload(self, file_path, cached=False):
        start = time.time()
        # Upload file
        duration = time.time() - start
        return duration
    
    async def benchmark_model_routing(self, prompt):
        start = time.time()
        # Route prompt
        duration = time.time() - start
        return duration
    
    def measure_memory(self):
        process = psutil.Process()
        return process.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024  # MB
    
    def generate_report(self):
        # Generate performance report
        pass
```

## 📊 BASELINE METRICS (Pre-Optimization)

**Note:** These are estimated baselines since we don't have pre-optimization measurements.

| Metric | Pre-Optimization (Estimated) | Post-Optimization (Target) |
|--------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| File upload (first) | 2-3 seconds | 2 seconds |
| File upload (cached) | 2-3 seconds | < 0.1 seconds |
| Parallel upload (5 files) | 10-15 seconds | 2-3 seconds |
| Model routing | 0.05-0.1 seconds | < 0.01 seconds |
| Memory usage (idle) | 150-200 MB | < 200 MB |
| Memory usage (load) | 400-600 MB | < 500 MB |

## ⚠️ LIMITATIONS

### Current Limitations:

1. **No Pre-Optimization Baselines**
   - Optimizations already applied
   - Cannot measure before/after directly
   - Must rely on current performance as validation

2. **Environment Variability**
   - Network latency affects file uploads
   - API response times vary
   - System load affects measurements

3. **Limited Test Data**
   - Need representative test files
   - Need diverse prompt samples
   - Need realistic workload patterns

4. **Manual Testing Required**
   - Some tests require user interaction
   - Automated testing has limitations
   - WebSocket connection issues
