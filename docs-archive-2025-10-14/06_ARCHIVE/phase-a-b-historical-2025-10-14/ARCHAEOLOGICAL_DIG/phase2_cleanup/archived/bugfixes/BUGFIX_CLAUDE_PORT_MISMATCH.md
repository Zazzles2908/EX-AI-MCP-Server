# BUGFIX: Claude Application Port Mismatch
**Date:** 2025-10-11 (11th October 2025, Friday) 10:30 AEDT  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Priority:** HIGH - Blocking Claude application from using EXAI

---

## üö® PROBLEM

**User Report:**
> "for some reason claude application is having difficulty currently to actually use exai"

**Root Cause:** Claude MCP configuration was pointing to the wrong WebSocket port.

---

## üîç INVESTIGATION

### Discovery Process

1. **Checked Claude Configuration Files**
   - Found `Daemon/mcp-config.claude.json`
   - Configuration looked correct except for port number

2. **Verified Current Server Port**
   ```bash
   python scripts/ws/ws_status.py
   # Output: ws_status: running | ws://127.0.0.1:8079 | pid=42904 | sessions=1 inflight=0/24
   ```

3. **Identified Mismatch**
   - **Claude Config:** `EXAI_WS_PORT: "8765"` (OLD PORT)
   - **Actual Server:** Running on port `8079` (CURRENT PORT)

---

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE

**Port Migration History:**
- **Old System:** WebSocket daemon ran on port `8765`
- **New System:** WebSocket shim runs on port `8079`
- **Problem:** Claude configuration was never updated after port migration

**Why This Happened:**
- Port change occurred during Phase 1 or earlier
- Claude configuration file was not updated
- Auggie and Augment Code configurations were updated correctly
- Claude configuration was overlooked

---

## ‚úÖ FIX APPLIED

**File Modified:** `Daemon/mcp-config.claude.json`

**Change:**
```diff
- "EXAI_WS_PORT": "8765",
+ "EXAI_WS_PORT": "8079",
```

**Lines Changed:** 15

---

## üß™ VERIFICATION

**Test 1: Configuration File**
```bash
cat Daemon/mcp-config.claude.json | grep EXAI_WS_PORT
# Expected: "EXAI_WS_PORT": "8079"
```
‚úÖ PASS

**Test 2: Server Status**
```bash
python scripts/ws/ws_status.py
# Expected: ws://127.0.0.1:8079
```
‚úÖ PASS

**Test 3: Claude Application** (User to verify)
- User needs to restart Claude application
- User needs to test EXAI tool call from Claude
- Expected: Tool calls should work correctly

---

## üìä IMPACT ASSESSMENT

**Before Fix:**
- ‚ùå Claude application could not connect to EXAI server
- ‚ùå All EXAI tool calls from Claude failed
- ‚ùå Claude users had no access to EXAI functionality

**After Fix:**
- ‚úÖ Claude application can connect to correct port
- ‚úÖ EXAI tool calls from Claude should work
- ‚úÖ Claude users have full EXAI functionality

---

## üéØ RELATED CONFIGURATIONS

**All MCP Client Configurations:**

1. **Auggie CLI** (`Daemon/mcp-config.auggie.json`)
   - Port: `8765` (Auggie uses old daemon)
   - Status: ‚úÖ CORRECT (Auggie has its own daemon)

2. **Augment Code** (`Daemon/mcp-config.augmentcode.json`)
   - Port: `8079` (Uses WebSocket shim)
   - Status: ‚úÖ CORRECT

3. **Claude Desktop** (`Daemon/mcp-config.claude.json`)
   - Port: `8765` ‚Üí `8079` (FIXED)
   - Status: ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## üìù LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Port Migration Checklist Needed**
   - When changing ports, need to update ALL client configurations
   - Create checklist of all configuration files that reference ports
   - Verify each configuration after port changes

2. **Configuration Validation**
   - Need automated validation of MCP configurations
   - Check that all clients point to correct ports
   - Add to Task 2.D (Testing Enhancements)

3. **Documentation**
   - Port numbers should be documented in central location
   - Configuration guide should list all client configs
   - Add port verification to health check

## üîß RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate:
- [x] Fix Claude configuration port
- [ ] User to restart Claude application
- [ ] User to test EXAI from Claude
- [ ] Update master checklist

### Future (Task 2.D):
- [ ] Create configuration validation script
- [ ] Add port verification to health check
- [ ] Create port migration checklist
- [ ] Add automated tests for all MCP configurations

## üìÅ FILES MODIFIED

**Modified (1 file):**
1. `Daemon/mcp-config.claude.json` (line 15 - port changed from 8765 to 8079)

**Documentation Created:**
1. `docs/ARCHAEOLOGICAL_DIG/phase2_cleanup/BUGFIX_CLAUDE_PORT_MISMATCH.md` (this file)

---

## üöÄ USER ACTION REQUIRED

**To Complete Fix:**

1. **Restart Claude Application**
   - Close Claude completely
   - Reopen Claude
   - This will reload the MCP configuration

2. **Test EXAI Functionality**
   - Try calling any EXAI tool from Claude
   - Example: "Use chat tool to say hello"
   - Verify tool call succeeds

3. **Report Results**
   - Confirm whether EXAI tools now work from Claude
   - Report any remaining issues

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ CONFIGURATION FIXED - USER TESTING REQUIRED  
**Server:** Running on ws://127.0.0.1:8079  
**Next:** User to restart Claude and test
