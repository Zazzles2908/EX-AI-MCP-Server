**Date:** 2025-10-10 (10th October 2025, Thursday)  
**Category:** Security, Role-Based Access Control  
**Status:** üîç Investigation In Progress

---

## WHAT EXISTS

### Security Folder Structure
```
security/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py           # Package initialization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rbac.py               # Role-Based Access Control implementation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rbac_config.py        # RBAC configuration
```

**Total:** 2 Python files (RBAC system)

---

## FILE-BY-FILE ANALYSIS

### 1. rbac.py
**Purpose:** Role-Based Access Control implementation  
**Status:** ‚ùì Unknown if active  
**Likely Features:**
- User roles (admin, user, guest)
- Permission checks
- Access control decorators
- Authorization logic

### 2. rbac_config.py
**Purpose:** RBAC configuration  
**Status:** ‚ùì Unknown if active  
**Likely Features:**
- Role definitions
- Permission mappings
- Access policies
- Configuration loading

---

## DESIGN INTENT

### Expected RBAC Capabilities

**Role Management:**
- Define user roles
- Assign permissions to roles
- Hierarchical roles (admin > user > guest)

**Permission Checks:**
- Check if user has permission
- Decorator for protected functions
- API endpoint protection

**Access Control:**
- Tool access control (who can use which tools)
- Provider access control (who can use which providers)
- Model access control (who can use which models)

**Audit Trail:**
- Log access attempts
- Track permission denials
- Security event logging

---

## USE CASES

### 1. Multi-User System
**Scenario:** Multiple users sharing EXAI-MCP server

**Roles:**
- **Admin:** Full access to all tools, providers, models
- **Developer:** Access to dev tools, limited providers
- **Viewer:** Read-only access, no execution

**Permissions:**
- `tool.execute` - Execute tools
- `provider.use` - Use providers
- `model.select` - Select models
- `config.modify` - Modify configuration

### 2. API Key Management
**Scenario:** Different API keys for different users

**Access Control:**
- User A: Can use Kimi only
- User B: Can use GLM only
- Admin: Can use both

### 3. Cost Control
**Scenario:** Limit expensive operations

**Permissions:**
- `model.use.expensive` - Use expensive models (o3, kimi-thinking)
- `model.use.cheap` - Use cheap models (glm-4.5-flash)
- `tool.use.workflow` - Use workflow tools (expensive)
- `tool.use.simple` - Use simple tools (cheap)

---

## CONNECTION ANALYSIS

### Where Should RBAC Connect?

**1. Request Handler (src/server/handlers/request_handler.py)**
- Check permissions before tool execution
- Verify user can use selected model
- Log access attempts

**2. Tools (tools/)**
- Protect tool execution with RBAC decorator
- Check permissions before running
- Return 403 if unauthorized

**3. Providers (src/providers/)**
- Check if user can use provider
- Verify API key access
- Enforce rate limits per user

**4. WebSocket Daemon (src/daemon/ws_server.py)**
- Authenticate connections
- Verify user identity
- Enforce session limits

## INVESTIGATION TASKS

### Task 1: Check Current Usage
- [ ] Search for `from security import` in codebase
- [ ] Search for `import security` in codebase
- [ ] Check if RBAC is active
- [ ] Identify entry points

### Task 2: Read RBAC Implementation
- [ ] Read rbac.py to understand implementation
- [ ] Read rbac_config.py to understand configuration
- [ ] Document roles and permissions
- [ ] Identify design patterns

### Task 3: Check Integration Points
- [ ] Is RBAC used in request_handler?
- [ ] Is RBAC used in tools?
- [ ] Is RBAC used in providers?
- [ ] Is RBAC used in daemon?

### Task 4: Check Configuration
- [ ] Is RBAC_ENABLED in .env?
- [ ] Are roles defined in config?
- [ ] Are permissions mapped?
- [ ] Is user database configured?

### Task 5: Check User Management
- [ ] How are users identified?
- [ ] Where are user credentials stored?
- [ ] Is Supabase used for user management?
- [ ] Is authentication implemented?

---

## PRELIMINARY FINDINGS

### Finding 1: RBAC System Exists
- ‚úÖ 2 RBAC scripts
- ‚úÖ Separate config file
- ‚ùì Unknown if active or planned

### Finding 2: Minimal Security Folder
**Only 2 files suggests:**
- Basic RBAC implementation
- May be planned for expansion
- Or may be minimal viable security

**Missing (potentially):**
- Authentication (login/logout)
- User management
- API key management
- Rate limiting
- Encryption/secrets management

### Finding 3: Single-User vs Multi-User
**Critical Question:**
- Is EXAI-MCP designed for single user?
- Or multi-user system?
- Or both (configurable)?

**If single-user:**
- RBAC may be overkill
- Security may be planned for future

**If multi-user:**
- RBAC is essential
- Need authentication
- Need user database

---

## CRITICAL QUESTIONS

### 1. Is RBAC Active?
**Check:**
- Are security scripts imported?
- Are permissions checked?
- Are roles enforced?

### 2. Single-User or Multi-User?
**Determine:**
- Is system designed for one user?
- Or multiple users?
- Or both (configurable)?

### 3. Authentication
**Questions:**
- How are users authenticated?
- Where are credentials stored?
- Is Supabase used for auth?
- Is OAuth supported?

### 4. User Identification
**Questions:**
- How is user identified in requests?
- Session tokens?
- API keys?
- IP address?

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS (PRELIMINARY)

### Phase 1: Determine Status (Immediate)

**Action:** Check if RBAC is active

**Search for imports:**
```bash
grep -r "from security import" .
grep -r "import security" .
grep -r "rbac" .
```

**Check .env:**
```bash
grep "RBAC" .env
grep "AUTH" .env
grep "SECURITY" .env
```

### Phase 2: Read Implementation

**Action:** Read rbac.py and rbac_config.py

**Understand:**
- What roles are defined?
- What permissions exist?
- How are checks performed?
- What's the design pattern?

### Phase 3: Determine Use Case

**Action:** Understand if single-user or multi-user

**If Single-User:**
- RBAC may not be needed
- Security can be simplified
- Focus on API key protection

**If Multi-User:**
- RBAC is essential
- Need full authentication
- Need user database (Supabase?)

### Phase 4: Integration Strategy

**If Active:**
- Verify permissions are checked
- Test access control
- Review security policies

**If Planned:**
- Determine priority
- Create activation plan
- Define roles and permissions
- Set up user management

## SECURITY BEST PRACTICES

### 1. API Key Protection
- Never log API keys
- Store in .env (not in code)
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use separate keys per user

### 2. Access Control
- Principle of least privilege
- Default deny (whitelist, not blacklist)
- Audit all access attempts
- Log permission denials

### 3. Authentication
- Strong password requirements
- Session timeout
- Token expiration
- Multi-factor authentication (future)

### 4. Secrets Management
- Use environment variables
- Never commit secrets to git
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Use Supabase for user credentials

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate:** Search for security/RBAC imports
2. **Then:** Read rbac.py and rbac_config.py
3. **Then:** Determine single-user vs multi-user
4. **Then:** Check .env for security config
5. **Finally:** Recommend security strategy

**STATUS: AWAITING IMPORT ANALYSIS**

Next: Search codebase for security imports and read RBAC implementation.
