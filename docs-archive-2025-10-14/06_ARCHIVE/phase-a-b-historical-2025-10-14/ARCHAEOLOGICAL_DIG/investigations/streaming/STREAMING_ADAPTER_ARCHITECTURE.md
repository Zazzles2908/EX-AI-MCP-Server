## INVESTIGATION TASKS

### Task 1: Check Current Usage
- [ ] Search for `from streaming import` in codebase
- [ ] Search for `import streaming` in codebase
- [ ] Check if streaming is active
- [ ] Identify entry points

### Task 2: Read Streaming Adapter
- [ ] Read streaming_adapter.py
- [ ] Understand implementation
- [ ] Document streaming protocol
- [ ] Identify design patterns

### Task 3: Check Provider Support
- [ ] Does Kimi provider support streaming?
- [ ] Does GLM provider support streaming?
- [ ] Are streaming APIs configured?
- [ ] Are streaming endpoints used?

### Task 4: Check Client Support
- [ ] Does WebSocket daemon support streaming?
- [ ] Does MCP shim support streaming?
- [ ] Can Augment IDE handle streams?
- [ ] Is streaming protocol documented?

### Task 5: Check Configuration
- [ ] Is STREAMING_ENABLED in .env?
- [ ] Are streaming parameters configured?
- [ ] Is buffer size configured?
- [ ] Is timeout configured?

---

## PRELIMINARY FINDINGS

### Finding 1: Minimal Streaming Implementation
- ✅ 1 streaming adapter file
- ❓ Unknown if active or planned
- 🚨 Only 1 file suggests basic implementation

### Finding 2: Potential Overlap with tools/streaming/
**Discovered:** There's also a `tools/streaming/` folder!

**Questions:**
- Are these related?
- Is one deprecated?
- Should they be consolidated?

**Need to investigate:**
- What's in tools/streaming/?
- How does it relate to streaming/?
- Which is active?

### Finding 3: Environment-Gated Streaming
**From memory:** User mentioned:
> "Environment-gated streaming"

**This suggests:**
- Streaming is configurable
- Can be enabled/disabled via .env
- May not be active by default

---

## CRITICAL QUESTIONS

### 1. Is Streaming Active?
**Check:**
- Are streaming scripts imported?
- Are responses streamed?
- Is streaming configured?

### 2. Which Streaming System?
**Options:**
- `streaming/streaming_adapter.py`
- `tools/streaming/` (need to investigate)
- Both (different purposes?)
- Neither (planned for future?)

### 3. Provider Support
**Questions:**
- Do Kimi/GLM APIs support streaming?
- Are streaming endpoints configured?
- Is streaming tested?

### 4. Client Support
**Questions:**
- Can Augment IDE handle streams?
- Does MCP protocol support streaming?
- Is WebSocket streaming implemented?

---

## STREAMING PROTOCOLS

### Common Streaming Patterns

**1. Server-Sent Events (SSE)**
```
data: {"chunk": "Hello"}
data: {"chunk": " world"}
data: {"chunk": "!"}
data: [DONE]
```

**2. WebSocket Streaming**
```json
{"type": "chunk", "data": "Hello"}
{"type": "chunk", "data": " world"}
{"type": "chunk", "data": "!"}
{"type": "done"}
```

**3. JSONL Streaming**
```json
{"chunk": "Hello"}
{"chunk": " world"}
{"chunk": "!"}
{"done": true}
```

**4. OpenAI Streaming Format**
```json
{"choices": [{"delta": {"content": "Hello"}}]}
{"choices": [{"delta": {"content": " world"}}]}
{"choices": [{"delta": {"content": "!"}}]}
{"choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop"}]}
```

## RECOMMENDATIONS (PRELIMINARY)

### Phase 1: Determine Status (Immediate)

**Action:** Check if streaming is active

**Search for imports:**
```bash
grep -r "from streaming import" .
grep -r "import streaming" .
grep -r "streaming_adapter" .
```

**Check .env:**
```bash
grep "STREAMING" .env
grep "STREAM" .env
```

### Phase 2: Investigate tools/streaming/

**Action:** Check what's in tools/streaming/

**Questions:**
- What files exist?
- What's the purpose?
- How does it relate to streaming/?
- Which is active?

### Phase 3: Read Implementation

**Action:** Read streaming_adapter.py

**Understand:**
- What protocol is used?
- How are streams handled?
- What's the error handling?
- What's the buffer strategy?

### Phase 4: Test Streaming

**Action:** Test if streaming works

**Test:**
- Make streaming request
- Verify chunks received
- Check error handling
- Measure latency

### Phase 5: Integration Strategy

**If Active:**
- Verify streaming works
- Test with all providers
- Optimize buffer size
- Document protocol

**If Planned:**
- Prioritize implementation
- Choose streaming protocol
- Implement provider support
- Test with clients
