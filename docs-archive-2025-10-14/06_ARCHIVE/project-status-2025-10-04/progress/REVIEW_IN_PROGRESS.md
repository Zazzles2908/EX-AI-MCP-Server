## 🔍 **MONITORING**

### **What to Watch For:**

1. **Success Indicators:**
   - ✅ "Batch X reviewed successfully"
   - ✅ "Raw response saved to: ..."
   - ✅ "Cache ID: design_context_..."

2. **Warning Indicators:**
   - ⚠️ "File upload failed for ..."
   - ⚠️ "Skipping file and continuing..."
   - These are EXPECTED and handled gracefully

3. **Error Indicators:**
   - ❌ Script crash (process stops)
   - ❌ Repeated upload failures
   - ❌ Timeout errors

## 📋 **NEXT STEPS (After Completion)**

### **1. Verify Results:**
- [ ] Check all 14 KIMI_RAW_BATCH_*.md files exist
- [ ] Check KIMI_CODE_REVIEW_src.json exists
- [ ] Review total issue count
- [ ] Check for any skipped files

### **2. Review Findings:**
- [ ] Critical issues (immediate attention)
- [ ] High priority issues (important)
- [ ] Medium/Low issues (nice to have)

### **3. Language Verification:**
- [ ] Check if responses are in English
- [ ] Note any Chinese error messages (expected)

### **4. Cost Verification:**
- [ ] Check Moonshot platform for actual cost
- [ ] Verify cache savings

---

## 🚀 **STATUS: RUNNING SMOOTHLY**

**All systems operational:**
- ✅ Error handling working
- ✅ Cache working
- ✅ Language fix applied
- ✅ No crashes so far

**Estimated completion:** ~13:14 (10-12 minutes from start)
