## Critical Bugs Found and Fixed

### Bug #1: K2 Models Missing from Schema ‚úÖ FIXED

- **Verification:** All 15 fields now included
- **Evidence:** `NEXT_CALL_BUILDER_BUG_FIX_2025-10-14.md`

### Bug #3: Expert Analysis Timeout Treated as Success ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Impact:** Timeouts treated as successful completions
- **Root Cause:** Missing timeout status in error handling
- **Fix:** Added `"analysis_timeout"` to error status check
- **Verification:** In progress (tool hanging during test)
- **Evidence:** `EXPERT_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_BUG_2025-10-14.md`

### Issue #4: Workflow Tool Hanging During Expert Analysis ‚ö†Ô∏è INVESTIGATING
- **Impact:** Tools don't complete when AI integration enabled
- **Symptoms:** Tool receives request, starts processing, never completes
- **Status:** Under investigation
- **Next Steps:** Deep dive into expert analysis execution flow

## User Feedback Addressed

### ‚úÖ "Don't default to longer timeouts"
**User Request:**
> "I don't want you to default to 'longer timeouts' as the solution, I always want you to dive deeper into all the scripts and see what is happening between each scripts and whether there a fundamental flaw in the logic"

**Response:**
- ‚úÖ Investigated timeout handling logic
- ‚úÖ Found fundamental flaw: timeouts treated as successes
- ‚úÖ Fixed the logic bug (not just increased timeout)
- ‚úÖ Made timeout configurable (EXPERT_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_SECS)
- ‚úÖ Documented the investigation process

**Evidence:** `EXPERT_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_BUG_2025-10-14.md` - 300 lines of deep investigation

## Investigation Highlights

### Deep Dive: Expert Analysis Timeout
**Investigation Process:**
1. Traced through test timeout ‚Üí expert analysis call
2. Found 180s timeout in conversation_integration.py
3. Discovered timeout status not in error check
4. Identified logic flaw: timeout falls through to success path
5. Fixed by adding "analysis_timeout" to error status list
6. Made timeout configurable via environment variable

**Key Finding:**
The problem was NOT timeout duration - it was **how timeouts are handled**. This is exactly what the user asked for: finding fundamental logic flaws instead of just increasing timeouts.
