# WorkflowTools Test Failure Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Test Script:** `scripts/testing/test_workflow_tools_part2.py`  
**Status:** ❌ ALL 5 TESTS FAILING  
**Error:** "error: None" for all tools  

---

## Test Results

```
TEST 8/12: precommit - Pre-commit Checks Workflow
❌ FAILED: precommit returned error: None

TEST 9/12: docgen - Documentation Generation Workflow
❌ FAILED: docgen returned error: None

TEST 10/12: tracer - Code Tracing Workflow
❌ FAILED: tracer returned error: None

TEST 11/12: consensus - Multi-Model Consensus Workflow
❌ FAILED: consensus returned error: None

TEST 12/12: planner - Planning Workflow
❌ FAILED: planner returned error: None

Tests passed: 0/5
```

## Problem Analysis

### Issue: "error: None"

The error message "error: None" indicates that:
1. The tool call is reaching the server
2. The server is processing the request
3. The response is coming back
4. BUT the response doesn't contain expected `ok: true` or proper result

**This suggests:**
- Tools may be timing out
- Tools may be returning empty responses
- WebSocket connection may be closing before tool completes
- Response format may be incorrect

---

## Comparison with Working Tests

### Working Tests (test_all_workflow_tools.py)
- ✅ analyze - PASSING
- ✅ codereview - PASSING
- ✅ debug - PASSING
- ✅ refactor - PASSING
- ✅ secaudit - PASSING
- ✅ thinkdeep - PASSING

### Failing Tests (test_workflow_tools_part2.py)
- ❌ precommit - FAILING
- ❌ docgen - FAILING
- ❌ tracer - FAILING
- ❌ consensus - FAILING
- ❌ planner - FAILING

**Pattern:** The first 6 tools work, the next 5 don't. This suggests:
- Different tool implementation?
- Different test parameters?
- Different timeout requirements?
- Server state issue?

---

## Investigation Needed

### 1. Check Server Logs
Need to check daemon logs to see:
- Are tools receiving requests?
- Are tools starting execution?
- Are tools completing execution?
- What errors are occurring?

### 2. Check Tool Implementation
Need to verify:
- Do these 5 tools exist in the codebase?
- Are they properly registered?
- Do they have different requirements?

### 3. Check Test Parameters
Need to compare:
- Are test parameters correct for these tools?
- Do they need different file paths?
- Do they need different models?
- Do they need longer timeouts?

### 4. Check WebSocket Connection
Need to verify:
- Is connection staying open long enough?
- Are progress messages being sent?
- Is final result being sent?

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Debug)
1. Add verbose logging to test script
2. Check server logs during test run
3. Verify tools are registered and available
4. Test one tool at a time manually

### Short-term (Fix)
1. Identify root cause of failures
2. Fix tool implementation or test parameters
3. Re-run tests to verify fixes
4. Document any tool-specific requirements

### Long-term (Prevent)
1. Add better error messages to tools
2. Add timeout handling to tests
3. Add progress reporting to long-running tools
4. Create tool-specific test configurations

## Current Status

**Test Status:** ❌ FAILING (0/5 passing)  
**Root Cause:** UNKNOWN (needs investigation)  
**Impact:** Cannot verify 5/12 WorkflowTools are working  
**Priority:** HIGH (blocks Phase B completion)  

**Next Step:** Investigate server logs and tool implementation

---

## Workaround

Until tests are fixed, these tools can be tested manually:
1. Start server
2. Connect via WebSocket
3. Send tool call manually
4. Observe response
5. Document behavior

**This is NOT a substitute for automated tests, but can verify basic functionality.**

**Status:** Analysis complete, investigation needed  
**Blocker:** Yes - prevents Phase B completion  
**Assigned:** Pending investigation
