## 📝 Key Decisions

1. **Active vs Archive:** Clear separation between current work and historical content
2. **Single Source of Truth:** Each piece of information lives in exactly one place
3. **Numbered Directories:** 01-06 prefix for clear ordering
4. **Preserved system-reference:** Kept as-is (maintained separately)
5. **Comprehensive Archives:** All historical content preserved, not deleted

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Reorganization Complete** - All phases executed successfully
2. ⏳ **Begin MCP Implementation** - Week 1, Day 1-2 (FileUploader class)
3. ⏳ **Update Task Tracker** - Mark reorganization complete
