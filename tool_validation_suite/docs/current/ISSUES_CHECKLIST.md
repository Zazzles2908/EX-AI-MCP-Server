# üö® Section 1: Production System Issues

## Critical Priority

### [CRITICAL] Error Message Truncation in Tool Responses
**Affected Tools:** 19 tools (challenge, consensus, docgen, planner, refactor, secaudit, testgen, thinkdeep, tracer, and others)

**Problem:**
Error messages are being truncated mid-sentence, making debugging impossible. Watcher detected this in 25+ observations.

**Evidence:**
```
- "Error message appears truncated (ends with 'input_type=di')" - consensus
- "Error message appears truncated (ends with 'input_typ')" - tracer
- "Error message is truncated and incomplete" - secaudit
- "Truncated error message ending with 'inpu'" - analyze
```

**Affected Files:**
- `tools/workflows/*.py` - All workflow tools
- Likely in base error handling or response formatting

**Recommended Fix:**
- [ ] Investigate response size limits in MCP protocol
- [ ] Check if error messages are being truncated in `src/server/handlers/request_handler.py`
- [ ] Review `src/core/base_models.py` for response size constraints
- [ ] Increase max response size or implement proper error message handling
- [ ] Add tests to verify complete error messages are returned

**Priority Justification:** Truncated errors make production debugging nearly impossible.

---

### [CRITICAL] Inconsistent Success Flag with Error Conditions
**Affected Tools:** 15 tools (challenge, consensus, docgen, planner, refactor, secaudit, testgen, thinkdeep, tracer, and others)

**Problem:**
Tools return `success: true` while simultaneously reporting validation errors or failures. This creates confusion about actual operation status.

**Evidence:**
```json
// From refactor_basic_glm.json
{
  "anomalies": [
    "Success flag contradicts the error message",
    "Test marked as passed despite validation error in output"
  ]
}

// From secaudit_basic_glm.json
{
  "anomalies": [
    "Success flag set to true while indicating secaudit failure"
  ]
}
```

**Affected Files:**
- `tools/workflows/challenge.py`
- `tools/workflows/consensus.py`
- `tools/workflows/docgen.py`
- `tools/workflows/planner.py`
- `tools/workflows/refactor.py`
- `tools/workflows/secaudit.py`
- `tools/workflows/testgen.py`
- `tools/workflows/thinkdeep.py`
- `tools/workflows/tracer.py`
- Possibly in base tool class: `src/core/base_tool.py`

**Recommended Fix:**
- [ ] Review error handling in base tool class
- [ ] Ensure validation errors set `success: false`
- [ ] Add validation in response builder to check consistency
- [ ] Update all workflow tools to properly set success flag
- [ ] Add integration tests for error conditions

**Priority Justification:** Incorrect success flags can cause cascading failures in production workflows.

---

## High Priority

### [HIGH] Missing Log File Directory - Activity Tool
**Affected Tools:** activity

**Problem:**
Activity tool fails to access log file because directory doesn't exist: `C:\Project\EX-AI-MCP-Server\logs\mcp_activity.log`

**Evidence:**
```json
// From activity_basic_glm.json
{
  "anomalies": [
    "Log file not found or accessible: C:\\Project\\EX-AI-MCP-Server\\logs\\mcp_activity.log",
    "Response indicates success (true) while also reporting an error"
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Implement proper error handling for log file access by creating the log directory/file if it doesn't exist"
  ]
}
```

**Affected Files:**
- `tools/advanced/activity.py`
- Possibly logging configuration

**Recommended Fix:**
- [ ] Check if `logs/` directory exists in repository
- [ ] Add directory creation in activity tool initialization
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling if log file is inaccessible
- [ ] Consider using Python's `logging` module with proper configuration
- [ ] Update `.gitignore` to include `logs/` directory but not log files

**Priority Justification:** Tool fails silently, reporting success when it actually failed.

---

### [HIGH] Performance Metrics Not Being Collected
**Affected Tools:** ALL tools (61/61 observations show N/A metrics)

**Problem:**
Performance metrics (response_time, memory_mb, cpu_percent, cost_usd, tokens) are all showing "N/A" in test results.

**Evidence:**
```
- "All performance metrics marked as N/A" - 9 observations
- "Performance metrics all marked as N/A" - 4 observations
- "No performance metrics were recorded" - 2 observations
```

**Affected Files:**
- `tool_validation_suite/utils/performance_monitor.py`
- `tool_validation_suite/utils/test_runner.py`
- Possibly MCP client integration

**Recommended Fix:**
- [ ] Verify `PerformanceMonitor` is being instantiated correctly
- [ ] Check if metrics are being captured during test execution
- [ ] Ensure metrics are being passed to result collector
- [ ] Review `test_runner.py` to ensure performance monitoring is active
- [ ] Add logging to track where metrics collection fails

**Priority Justification:** Cannot track resource usage or optimize performance without metrics.

---

### [HIGH] Response Content Truncation
**Affected Tools:** provider_capabilities, version, status, chat, and others

**Problem:**
Response content is being truncated mid-sentence, losing important information.

**Evidence:**
```
- "Output appears truncated (ends with 'GLM_THINKING_')" - provider_capabilities
- "Content appears truncated mid-string in the installation path" - version
- "Content string appears truncated and malformed (ends with 'pre')" - status
- "Output appears truncated (ends with 'continuation_offer' without proper closing)" - chat
```

**Affected Files:**
- `src/server/handlers/request_handler.py` - Response formatting
- `src/daemon/ws_server.py` - WebSocket message handling
- Possibly MCP protocol message size limits

**Recommended Fix:**
- [ ] Check WebSocket message size limits
- [ ] Review MCP protocol response size constraints
- [ ] Ensure complete responses are being sent
- [ ] Add response size logging to identify truncation point
- [ ] Implement chunking for large responses if needed

**Priority Justification:** Truncated responses lose critical information for users.

---

### [HIGH] Empty Input Validation Failures
**Affected Tools:** 15+ tools (challenge, consensus, docgen, planner, refactor, secaudit, testgen, thinkdeep, tracer, etc.)

**Problem:**
Tools fail with validation errors when receiving empty or minimal input, but don't handle this gracefully.

**Evidence:**
```
- "Empty JSON input caused validation failure for required field 'step'" - consensus
- "Input JSON object is empty, missing required 'prompt' field" - challenge
- "Empty input provided for basic test variation" - kimi_upload_and_extract
```

**Affected Files:**
- All workflow tools in `tools/workflows/*.py`
- Base validation in `src/core/base_models.py`

**Recommended Fix:**
- [ ] Add proper input validation with clear error messages
- [ ] Return user-friendly errors for missing required fields
- [ ] Consider providing default values for optional fields
- [ ] Add validation at API entry point before tool execution
- [ ] Update Pydantic models to have better error messages

**Priority Justification:** Poor error messages frustrate users and make debugging difficult.

---

## Medium Priority

### [MEDIUM] JSON Output Formatting
**Affected Tools:** provider_capabilities, status, and others

**Problem:**
JSON responses are not formatted for readability (no pretty-printing).

**Evidence:**
```
- "JSON content not formatted for readability" - provider_capabilities
```

**Affected Files:**
- Response formatting in tool implementations
- `src/server/handlers/request_handler.py`

**Recommended Fix:**
- [ ] Add JSON pretty-printing option to response formatter
- [ ] Use `json.dumps(indent=2)` for better readability
- [ ] Make formatting configurable (compact vs pretty)
- [ ] Update all tools to use consistent formatting

---

### [MEDIUM] Validation Error Handling Inconsistency
**Affected Tools:** Multiple workflow tools

**Problem:**
Different tools handle validation errors differently - some mark as success, some as failure.

**Evidence:**
Multiple tools show "Test marked as passed despite validation error"

**Affected Files:**
- All workflow tools
- Base error handling

**Recommended Fix:**
- [ ] Standardize validation error handling across all tools
- [ ] Create base validation error class
- [ ] Ensure consistent error response format
- [ ] Document expected behavior for validation failures

---

### [MEDIUM] Outputs Count Inconsistency
**Affected Tools:** challenge, version, and others

**Problem:**
Tools report `outputs_count` that doesn't match actual number of outputs.

**Evidence:**
```
- "Outputs count of 2 seems inconsistent with error message" - challenge
- "Outputs count is 2 for a simple version command" - version
```

**Affected Files:**
- Response building logic in tools
- `src/core/base_models.py`

**Recommended Fix:**
- [ ] Review how outputs_count is calculated
- [ ] Ensure it matches actual outputs array length
- [ ] Add validation to check consistency
- [ ] Fix any tools with incorrect counting

---

### [MEDIUM] Selfcheck Tool Validation Score Inconsistency
**Affected Tools:** selfcheck

**Problem:**
Selfcheck reports 100% validation score despite test failure.

**Evidence:**
```json
// From selfcheck_edge_cases.json
{
  "anomalies": [
    "Test marked as failed but tool reports success",
    "Validation score is 100% despite test failure"
  ]
}
```

**Affected Files:**
- `tools/advanced/selfcheck.py`

**Recommended Fix:**
- [ ] Review selfcheck validation logic
- [ ] Ensure validation score reflects actual test results
- [ ] Fix inconsistency between test status and validation score

---

## Low Priority

### [LOW] Watcher Timeout Issues
**Affected Tools:** analyze, chat, refactor, status (4 observations)

**Problem:**
Watcher occasionally times out when analyzing tests (30-second timeout).

**Evidence:**
```
- "Watcher error: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='api.z.ai', port=443): Read timed out. (read timeout=30)" - 3 observations
- "Watcher error: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='open.bigmodel.cn', port=443): Read timed out. (read timeout=30)" - 1 observation
```

**Note:** This is already partially addressed (timeout increased to 60s, URL fixed to z.ai).

**Recommended Fix:**
- [ ] Monitor if 60s timeout is sufficient
- [ ] Consider increasing to 90s if issues persist
- [ ] Add retry logic for watcher API calls
- [ ] Log watcher performance metrics

---

### [LOW] Continuation Offer in Chat Responses
**Affected Tools:** chat

**Problem:**
Chat responses include `continuation_offer` field that may be unexpected.

**Evidence:**
```
- "Response contains 'continuation_available' status which may be unexpected for empty input" - chat
```

**Affected Files:**
- `tools/core/chat.py`

**Recommended Fix:**
- [ ] Document when continuation_offer is provided
- [ ] Ensure it's only included when appropriate
- [ ] Add tests for continuation behavior

---

# üß™ Section 2: Test Suite Infrastructure Issues

## Critical Priority

### [CRITICAL] Integration Tests - ConversationTracker API Mismatch
**Affected Tests:** 6 integration tests (ALL integration tests)

- `tool_validation_suite/tests/integration/test_file_upload_kimi.py`
- `tool_validation_suite/tests/integration/test_web_search_integration.py`

**Recommended Fix:**
- [ ] Check `ConversationTracker.create_conversation()` signature in `tool_validation_suite/utils/conversation_tracker.py`
- [ ] Update all integration test calls to match correct signature
- [ ] Verify expected parameters (likely provider name is the issue)
- [ ] Re-run all integration tests to verify fixes
- [ ] Add API signature tests to prevent future mismatches

---

### [CRITICAL] test_self-check.py - Syntax Error
**Affected Tests:** test_self-check.py

**Problem:**
Python doesn't allow hyphens in function names.

**Error:**
```python

```python
import sys
import io
sys.stdout = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout.buffer, encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')
```
- [ ] Remove emoji from print statements (alternative fix)
- [ ] Apply same fix to all test files that use emojis
- [ ] Re-run test to verify fix

---

## High Priority

### [HIGH] Test Status Marking Logic
