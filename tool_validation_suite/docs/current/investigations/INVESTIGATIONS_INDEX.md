# INVESTIGATIONS - Historical Root Cause Analyses

**Purpose:** Archive of investigations, root cause analyses, and problem-solving journeys  
**Audience:** Developers debugging similar issues, learning from past investigations  
**When to use:** When you need to understand how a problem was diagnosed and solved

## Files in This Folder (Chronological Order)

### 1. NEW_ISSUE_SDK_HANGING.md (First Report)
**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**What it is:** Initial report of SDK hanging issue  
**Key content:**
- Problem description
- Initial observations
- Initial hypothesis (later proven wrong)
- Next steps

**Why it matters:** Shows how the investigation started

---

### 2. CRITICAL_ISSUE_ANALYSIS_2025-10-06.md
**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**What it is:** Analysis of test script blocking issue  
**Key content:**
- Investigation of tests hanging indefinitely
- Root cause analysis (invalid test arguments)
- Timeout configuration mismatch
- Required fixes

**Why it matters:** First deep dive into the problem

---

### 3. ROOT_CAUSE_FOUND.md (Misdiagnosis)
**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**What it is:** Root cause identification (zhipuai SDK version mismatch)  
**Key content:**
- Discovered zhipuai SDK was v1.0.7 instead of v2.1.0
- Import fails, falls back to HTTP client
- HTTP fallback doesn't handle all parameters
- z.ai vs open.bigmodel.cn performance comparison

**Why it matters:** This was a MISDIAGNOSIS - the real root cause was HTTP timeout (60s → 300s). Shows the investigation process, including wrong turns.

**What it is:** Analysis of workflow tool timeout issues  
**Key content:**
- Systematic investigation of timeout problem
- Evidence gathering
- Hypothesis testing
- Root cause identification

**Why it matters:** Shows systematic investigation methodology

---

**Key content:**
- Investigation timeline
- Findings summary
- Fixes implemented
- Verification steps

**Why it matters:** Complete investigation summary

---

### 8. FINAL_FIX_SUMMARY.md
**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**What it is:** Summary of all fixes implemented  
**Key content:**
- List of all fixes
- Before/after comparison
- Verification results
- Next steps

**Why it matters:** Final summary of what was fixed

## The Investigation Journey

**The Complete Story:**
1. **NEW_ISSUE_SDK_HANGING.md** - Problem first identified
2. **CRITICAL_ISSUE_ANALYSIS_2025-10-06.md** - Deep dive begins
3. **ROOT_CAUSE_FOUND.md** - Wrong diagnosis (SDK version)
4. **ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS_WORKFLOW_TIMEOUT.md** - Correct diagnosis (HTTP timeout)
5. **EXECUTION_FLOW_ANALYSIS.md** - Understanding the system
6. **COMPLETE_SCRIPT_PATHWAY_ANALYSIS.md** - Detailed pathway analysis
7. **INVESTIGATION_COMPLETE.md** - Investigation summary
8. **FINAL_FIX_SUMMARY.md** - Final fixes summary

**Key Lesson:** The investigation process included wrong turns (SDK version misdiagnosis) before finding the real root cause (HTTP timeout 60s → 300s). This is normal and valuable to document.

---

## What Was Actually Fixed

**The Real Root Cause:**
- HTTP client timeout was 60 seconds
- Workflow tools needed 300 seconds
- HTTP client timed out before workflow completed
- Solution: Increase HTTP timeout to 300 seconds

**The Misdiagnosis:**
- Initially thought it was SDK version mismatch
- Later discovered this wasn't the root cause
- But the investigation led to discovering z.ai is 3x faster than official API
