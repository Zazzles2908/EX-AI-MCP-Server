# DOCUMENTATION AUDIT - tool_validation_suite/docs/current
## Comprehensive Analysis of All Markdown Files

**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Purpose:** Audit all markdown files to understand content, identify vital information, and prepare for reorganization  
**Total Files:** 22 markdown files

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After reading all 22 markdown files in `tool_validation_suite/docs/current`, I've identified:
- **3 Current/Active Documents** - Essential, keep in current/
- **8 Investigation Documents** - Historical, move to investigations/
- **4 Status/Checklist Documents** - Point-in-time status, move to status/
- **3 Guide Documents** - How-to guides, move to guides/
- **4 Recent Audit Documents** - Just created, keep in current/ or move to audit/

**Key Finding:** Many documents are historical investigations that should be archived. Only truly "current" documents should remain in current/.
