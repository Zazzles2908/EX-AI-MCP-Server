    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe debug tool implements a sophisticated structured investigation workflow with strong architectural foundations, but exhibits significant complexity through extensive customization layers and rigid enforcement patterns. While its systematic approach to root cause analysis is well-designed for complex debugging scenarios, the implementation carries maintainability risks due to deep framework coupling and cognitive overhead from numerous overrides. The tool's confidence-based workflow and comprehensive tracking mechanisms are standout strengths, though UX friction from mandatory pauses and potential performance bottlenecks in file processing require strategic attention.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Architectural Over-Engineering Through Excessive Customization\n**Insight:** The debug tool exhibits over-engineering via 20+ method overrides and complex state management, creating unnecessary cognitive load and fragility.\n**Evidence:** `DebugIssueTool` (lines 154-655) contains extensive overrides including `get_input_schema`, `customize_workflow_response`, and `get_step_guidance_message`. Status mapping logic (lines 617-645) manually converts generic workflow concepts to debug-specific terms, while state like `self.initial_issue` (line 166) introduces implicit coupling.\n**Impact:** High maintenance burden - changes to base workflow framework risk breaking debug functionality. New developers face steep learning curve due to scattered customization logic. Violates DRY principle through repeated status/field mappings.\n**Recommendation:** Extract debug-specific behaviors into strategy classes (e.g., `DebugResponseFormatter`, `InvestigationOrchestrator`) using composition over inheritance. Consolidate status/field mappings into configuration-driven approaches.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort, High payoff (reduces fragility and improves onboarding).\n\n### 2. Performance Risk in File Processing Pipeline\n**Insight:** Unbounded file content embedding during expert analysis preparation creates scalability bottlenecks.\n**Evidence:** `prepare_expert_analysis_context` (lines 339-397) calls `_prepare_file_content_for_prompt` (line 389) without size limits. The method processes all `relevant_files` (line 388) with no truncation or summarization logic, risking token overflow in large codebases.\n**Impact:** Memory exhaustion and API timeouts when debugging large projects. Degrades user experience through slow responses. Potential cost overruns from excessive LLM token usage.\n**Recommendation:** Implement intelligent file chunking with relevance scoring. Add configurable token limits and priority-based content inclusion (e.g., focus on `relevant_context` methods first).\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff (prevents production failures).\n\n### 3. UX Friction from Rigid Workflow Enforcement\n**Insight:** Mandatory step pauses and verbose guidance create unnecessary friction for experienced users.\n**Evidence:** Step guidance methods (lines 427-487) use imperative language like \"MANDATORY: DO NOT call debug tool again\" (line 438) and \"STOP! Do NOT call debug again yet\" (line 449). The tool description (lines 182-186) emphasizes enforcement over flexibility.\n**Impact:** Reduces tool adoption for simple debugging tasks. Frustrates power users who prefer direct control. Increases investigation time unnecessarily for straightforward issues.\n**Recommendation:** Introduce \"expert mode\" bypassing mandatory pauses. Add adaptive guidance based on issue complexity inferred from initial description. Allow step consolidation for high-confidence scenarios.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff (improves user satisfaction).\n\n### 4. Brittle Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms\n**Insight:** Critical operations lack error handling, risking investigation state corruption.\n**Evidence:** File operations in `_prepare_file_content_for_prompt` (line 389) and external model calls in `should_call_expert_analysis` (lines 322-337) have no try-catch blocks. No recovery mechanisms exist for failed investigation steps.\n**Impact:** Unhandled exceptions crash investigations, losing user progress. Inconsistent tool behavior under failure conditions reduces trust in debugging outcomes.\n**Recommendation:** Add defensive programming around file I/O and external API calls. Implement investigation checkpointing and rollback capabilities. Provide clear error recovery paths.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff (improves reliability).\n\n### 5. Ambiguous Expert Analysis Trigger Criteria\n**Insight:** Over-reliance on external model validation without clear necessity thresholds.\n**Evidence:** `should_call_expert_analysis` (lines 322-337) uses simplistic heuristics (file count, finding length) without considering issue complexity. The method lacks cost/benefit analysis for external validation.\n**Impact:** Unnecessary external model calls increase latency and costs. Inconsistent validation quality when expert analysis is triggered for trivial issues.\n**Recommendation:** Implement complexity scoring based on factors like codebase size, error type, and hypothesis confidence. Add cost-aware thresholds for external validation.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff (optimizes resource usage).\n\n## Quick Wins\n- **Add file path validation:** Prevent runtime errors by validating `files_checked` and `relevant_files` paths before processing\n- **Implement investigation logging:** Add structured logging at key workflow stages for debugging the tool itself\n- **Simplify confidence levels:** Consolidate \"very_high\" and \"almost_certain\" (lines 98-104) to reduce cognitive overhead\n- **Add progress indicators:** Visual step tracking (e.g., \"Step 2/5\") to improve user orientation during long investigations\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Modularization Phase (3-6 months):** Extract debug-specific logic into dedicated services, reducing class complexity by 40%\n2. **Performance Optimization (6-9 months):** Implement intelligent file processing with token-aware chunking and caching\n3. **UX Enhancement (9-12 months):** Develop adaptive workflow modes supporting both guided and expert debugging experiences\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Prioritize refactoring:** Start with extracting status mapping logic (lines 617-645) into a dedicated formatter class to immediately reduce coupling\n2. **Implement defensive programming:** Add error handling around file operations and external API calls within 2 sprints\n3. **Conduct user interviews:** Validate UX friction points with actual debug tool users to guide adaptive workflow design\n\nThis analysis reveals a functionally powerful but architecturally complex tool requiring strategic refactoring to maintain long-term viability. The recommendations focus on reducing cognitive load while preserving the tool's core strength in systematic investigation workflows.",
