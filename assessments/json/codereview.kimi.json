    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe codereview tool is a well-structured workflow orchestrator that successfully enforces systematic investigation patterns, but exhibits architectural over-engineering through excessive configuration layers, brittle inheritance hierarchies, and speculative complexity that will impede long-term maintainability. While the step-wise enforcement mechanism is sound, the codebase suffers from premature abstraction and configuration explosion that increases onboarding friction without proportional benefit.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Configuration Explosion & Over-Engineering\n**Insight:** 120-line field description dictionary (lines 36-120) and 200-line schema override (lines 243-317) create unnecessary complexity for a workflow tool.\n**Evidence:** `CODEREVIEW_WORKFLOW_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS` duplicates pydantic Field descriptions; `codereview_field_overrides` rebuilds schema information already available via introspection.\n**Impact:** New developers must understand 3 layers (pydantic → descriptions → overrides) to make simple field changes; 3x increase in maintenance surface.\n**Recommendation:** Eliminate description dictionary and schema overrides; rely on pydantic's native Field descriptions and automatic schema generation.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; High payoff (60% code reduction in configuration layer)\n\n### 2. Brittle Inheritance Hierarchy\n**Insight:** Deep inheritance chain (BaseTool → WorkflowTool → CodeReviewTool) with 18 hook methods creates tight coupling and hidden dependencies.\n**Evidence:** Methods like `get_completion_status()` (line 504) return magic strings; `prepare_work_summary()` (line 537) depends on parent class implementation details.\n**Impact:** Refactoring base classes risks breaking all workflow tools; new workflow types must implement 18+ hook methods correctly.\n**Recommendation:** Introduce composition over inheritance - create WorkflowBehavior interface that tools can implement selectively.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (decoupled architecture, easier testing)\n\n### 3. Speculative Flexibility Features\n**Insight:** Confidence-based workflow optimization (lines 98-107) and expert analysis bypass logic (lines 492-496) solve problems that don't exist yet.\n**Evidence:** 7-level confidence enum with \"almost_certain\" vs \"certain\" distinction; complex bypass logic for expert analysis based on confidence.\n**Impact:** Adds cognitive overhead for CLI agents who must understand subtle confidence differences; code paths that may never be used.\n**Recommendation:** Simplify to 3 levels (low/medium/high) and remove bypass logic - always perform expert analysis for consistency.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (simplified UX, reduced bug surface)\n\n### 4. State Management Fragility\n**Insight:** Tool instance stores request state (`initial_request`, `review_config` lines 191-192) creating potential for cross-request contamination.\n**Evidence:** Instance variables persist between calls; no cleanup mechanism visible; could leak data between review sessions.\n**Impact:** Race conditions in concurrent usage; difficult-to-debug state bugs in production.\n**Recommendation:** Make tools stateless - pass all required data through request parameters or use request-scoped context objects.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (eliminates entire class of bugs)\n\n### 5. Magic String Proliferation\n**Insight:** 15+ magic strings for statuses and keys scattered throughout codebase create hidden coupling.\n**Evidence:** \"code_review_complete_ready_for_implementation\" (line 506), \"complete_code_review\" (line 510), various status mappings (lines 658-663).\n**Impact:** Typos cause silent failures; refactoring requires global search/replace; no compile-time validation.\n**Recommendation:** Centralize all constants in enum classes; use type-safe status representations.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (reduced error rate, easier refactoring)\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Replace 120-line description dictionary with direct pydantic Field descriptions\n- Extract magic strings into centralized constants/enums\n- Remove unused temperature/thinking_mode fields (lines 167-169)\n- Simplify confidence enum from 7 to 3 levels\n- Add docstring examples showing minimal viable implementation\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1:** Eliminate configuration duplication and magic strings\n2. **Phase 2:** Refactor inheritance to composition-based architecture\n3. **Phase 3:** Implement stateless design with request-scoped context\n4. **Phase 4:** Extract common workflow patterns into reusable components\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate:** Create PR removing description dictionary and schema overrides (saves 200+ lines)\n2. **This Sprint:** Implement stateless design to eliminate cross-request contamination risk\n3. **Next Quarter:** Refactor to composition-based architecture for better extensibility\n\nThe tool's core workflow enforcement mechanism is sound, but the surrounding architecture suffers from premature optimization and speculative complexity that will hinder rather than help future development.",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
