# Phase G Implementation Plan (Maps to External Review Phase 3)

One-line YES/NO: YES — Production scaling plan with caching, balancing, auto-scaling, monitoring, and enterprise features.

EXAI-MCP summary: provider=GLM primary; cost=$0 for planning; total call time≈instant

## Objectives and Outcomes
- High-scale performance: advanced context caching, load balancing, auto-scaling, production monitoring
- Enterprise features: RBAC, audit/compliance, advanced security, DR

## Scope (Phase 3.1–3.2)
- 3.1 Performance & Scalability: caching, balancing, auto-scaling, monitoring
- 3.2 Enterprise Features: RBAC, audit/compliance, advanced security, backups/DR

## Deliverables
- caching/intelligent_cache.py (semantic-aware, TTL, limits)
- balancing/intelligent_lb.py (health, dynamic routing, failover)
- scaling/auto_scaling.py (predictor, optimizer, policies)
- monitoring/prod_monitoring.md + alerts config
- security/rbac.py, audit/system.py, security/advanced.py, dr/disaster_recovery.md
- Tests: performance/load, health checks, authz tests, DR drills

## Sequencing (6–8 weeks)
1) Performance Foundations (Weeks 1–2)
- IntelligentContextCache MVP: direct hits + semantic index stubs; eviction policy LRU+similarity
- Performance harnesses and metrics collection

2) Load Balancing & Monitoring (Weeks 2–3)
- IntelligentLoadBalancer MVP with health probes; dynamic routing
- Production monitoring skeleton + dashboards wiring

3) Auto-scaling (Weeks 3–4)
- AutoScalingManager MVP: demand predictor stubs, policies, cooldowns
- Integrate with monitoring signals

4) Enterprise Features (Weeks 4–6)
- RBAC roles/permissions, session tokens; audit logging categories
- Advanced security (encryption hooks, threat detection stub)
- DR doc + automated backup procedures

5) Hardening & Drills (Weeks 6–8)
- Load tests (50 concurrent users, <2s target)
- Security battery; DR failover table-top + limited drill

## Success Criteria (per external prompt)
- Cache hit rate >80% with >85% semantic accuracy
- Load distribution efficiency >90%
- Auto-scaling responds within 2 minutes
- Monitoring coverage >95%; alert accuracy >90%
- RBAC, audit/compliance, advanced security functional; DR procedures validated

## Dependencies
- Phases E and F completed; keys/configs; logging pipeline

## Risks/Mitigations
- Production drift: codify infra-as-config; version dashboards
- False positives in alerts: tune thresholds with historical data
- DR complexity: start minimal; verify restore paths first

## Verification Plan
- Load/perf tests, health checks, chaos-style probes for failover
- Security/penetration tests; RBAC/authorization tests; DR runbook validation

## Rollout
- Staged environment validation → production enablement → post-implementation review
