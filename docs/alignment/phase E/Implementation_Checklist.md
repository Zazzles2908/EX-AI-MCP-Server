One-line YES/NO: YES — Checklist covers all required Phase 1 items end-to-end.

EXAI-MCP summary: provider=GLM, model=glm-4.5-flash; cost=$0; total call time≈instant

## P1.1 Critical Repairs
- [ ] ConsensusRequest Pydantic: add required `findings: List[str]`
- [ ] Assessment parsing fallback implemented; errors downgraded with recovery
- [ ] Secure path validation: traversal/absolute injection blocked + tests
- [ ] Unit tests green: consensus schema, parsing, path sanitizer

## P1.2 Platform Integration
- [ ] HybridPlatformManager with Moonshot+Z.ai clients; unified auth
- [ ] Key rotation hooks and secure storage stubs
- [ ] Health checks (<=1s) and connectivity tests pass
- [ ] Error framework: retries/backoff/failure classes

## P1.3 Core Architecture
- [ ] IntelligentTaskRouter MVP committed and covered by tests
- [ ] AdvancedContextManager MVP supports 256K-aware budgeting
- [ ] Streaming adapter interfaces in place for both platforms

## P1.4 Testing & Validation
- [ ] System tests: consensus/platform/routing/context
- [ ] Security tests: injection/traversal/DOS-lite; sanitizer
- [ ] Performance baselines captured (consensus x100; router/context)
- [ ] Quick UX proxy flows validated via CLI

## Success Criteria Confirmation
- [ ] Consensus 100% restored; JSON parsing >95%
- [ ] 0 critical path vulnerabilities
- [ ] Platform auth + health OK; error framework logging
- [ ] Routing accuracy ≥90% tests; 256K handled
- [ ] Streaming interface compiled and ready

## Artifacts
- [ ] Test reports and benchmark logs saved to docs/sweep_reports/
- [ ] Updated docs under docs/alignment/phase E/
