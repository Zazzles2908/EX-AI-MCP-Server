# Phase D Overview — Stabilize, Validate, and Document (GLM/Kimi)

Objectives
- Stabilize EXAI‑MCP toolchain (status/chat/analyze/codereview/testgen) after prior registry/daemon glitches
- Ensure cost‑aware ModelRouter defaults (glm‑4.5‑flash first; flip to Kimi on Option‑B or triggers)
- Guarantee top‑of‑response MCP Call Summary stamping everywhere
- Produce repeatable validation evidence and Phase D documentation

Scope
- Runtime: VS Code + EXAI‑MCP WS shim (Windows), providers GLM + Kimi, ROUTER_ENABLED=true
- Tools: workflow (analyze, codereview, planner, testgen, debug, tracer), simple chat
- Observability: router DEBUG [ROUTER_DECISION] + server summary stamp; activity/server logs as primary evidence

Non‑Goals
- No broad feature additions; no provider credentials changes; no push to remote until owner confirms

Key Artifacts and Paths
- Evidence runs: docs/alignment/mcp_runs/
- Phase D docs: docs/alignment/phase D/
- Sweep reports: docs/sweep_reports/phase4_exai_review/
- Router logs: utils/model_router.py emits [ROUTER_DECISION]
- Summary utils: utils/summary.py (cost/duration/OK classification)

Primary Sources
- External reviews in docs/sweep_reports/_archive_legacy (phase1/2/3/4/5)
- Implementation strategy docs in docs/alignment/phaseA/B/C
- ModelRouter PR1 log: docs/alignment/phase D/PR1_log.md

Execution Model
- Work on safety branch feat/docs-restore-phaseD-from-stash
- Validate via EXAI‑MCP direct calls; record evidence; restore docs; avoid pushing until approval

Success Criteria (high‑level)
- Status + chat + analyze callable (evidence in logs and mcp_runs)
- MCP Call Summary present; cost/duration labels sane; router decision logs visible
- Phase D docs (this README, upgrade plan, checklist) present and current
- All changes committed to safety branch only
