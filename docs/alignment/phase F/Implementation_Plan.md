# Phase F Implementation Plan (Maps to External Review Phase 2)

One-line YES/NO: YES — Plan sequences advanced agentic capabilities with safety rails and measurable outcomes.

EXAI-MCP summary: provider=GLM primary, Kimi targeted; cost=$0 for planning; total call time≈instant

## Objectives and Outcomes
- Autonomous workflow execution with planning and monitoring
- Intelligent error recovery and self-optimization
- Proactive monitoring and anomaly detection
- UX: progressive disclosure, NL commands, suggestions, friendly errors
- Unified tool framework + intelligent tool chaining + parameter suggestions
- Hybrid reasoning modes + cost optimization + predictive maintenance + analytics

## Scope (Phase 2.1–2.4)
- 2.1 Autonomous capabilities + recovery + self-optimization + monitoring
- 2.2 Progressive UX + NL command processor + suggestions + friendly errors
- 2.3 Unified tool framework + tool chaining + parameter suggestions + performance selection
- 2.4 Hybrid reasoning modes + cost optimization + predictive maintenance + analytics dashboard

## Deliverables
- workflows/autonomous_engine.py, workflows/error_recovery.py, workflows/learning/
- monitoring/proactive_monitor.py
- ui/progressive_interface.md (design), nl/nl_commands.py, suggestions/engine.py, messages/friendly_errors.py
- tools/unified_framework.py, tools/tool_chaining.py, tools/parameter_suggestion.py, tools/perf_selection.py
- reasoning/hybrid_engine.py, cost/cost_optimization.py, maintenance/predictive.py, analytics/dashboard_stub.md
- Tests for each component

## Sequencing (6–8 weeks)
1) Engine Foundations (Weeks 1–2)
- AutonomousWorkflowEngine skeleton + execution loop + logging
- IntelligentErrorRecovery with pattern registry; async recovery hooks
- Proactive monitoring skeleton; anomaly detection stubs

2) UX Layer (Weeks 2–3)
- NL command processor MVP (intent patterns + param extraction)
- Progressive disclosure interface configs; friendly error messages
- Suggestion engine scaffold

3) Unified Tools & Chaining (Weeks 3–5)
- UnifiedTool base + manager; performance tracker stubs
- Tool chaining with simple dependency graph; parallel groups
- Parameter suggestion MVP; performance-based selection stub

4) Hybrid Reasoning & Cost (Weeks 5–6)
- Reasoning mode selection with thresholds; integrate with router
- Cost optimization engine MVP; budget/usage stubs

5) Predictive/Analytics (Weeks 6–8)
- Predictive maintenance stubs; analytics dashboard data model
- Tighten monitoring; close feedback loops

## Success Criteria (per external prompt)
- Autonomous complex workflow success >80%
- Error recovery >90% recovery rate in tests
- NL intent recognition >90% on sample set; UI adaptation >85%
- Tool chaining success >90%; parameter suggestion accuracy >80%
- Hybrid mode selection >90% optimal; cost reduction >25% on scenarios
- Proactive monitoring anomaly detection >95%

## Dependencies
- Phase E completed (platforms, router/context, streaming interface)
- Keys, configs, SecureInputValidator

## Risks/Mitigations
- Complexity creep: deliver stubs first, iterate with tests
- Accuracy tuning: create small curated test packs; measure and iterate
- Cost tracking: start with estimates; later wire real telemetry

## Verification Plan
- Component tests + scenario suites per capability
- Simulator workflows for multi-step autonomy
- Metrics recorded to docs/sweep_reports with thresholds

## Rollout
- Merge per sub-module with tests; run scenario suite; docs; PR
