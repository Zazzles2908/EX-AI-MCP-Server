## 🎯 The Core Problem (TL;DR)

### What's Broken:
- **Workflow tools hang for 10 minutes** instead of timing out at 2 minutes
- **No progress updates** during long operations (users think system is frozen)
- **Workflow tools don't log** execution (impossible to debug)
- **Expert validation disabled** due to duplicate call bug
- **Timeout configs scattered** across 15+ files with no coordination

### Why It's Broken:
- **Timeout hierarchy inverted:** Outer timeouts (600s) prevent inner timeouts (25s) from triggering
- **No progress heartbeat:** Long operations provide no feedback
- **Different code paths:** Workflow tools use different execution path than simple tools
- **No coordination:** Multiple timeout values with no hierarchy

### The Fix:
- **Week 1:** Fix timeout hierarchy, add progress heartbeat, unify logging
- **Week 2:** Fix expert validation, standardize configs
- **Week 3:** Verify web search, simplify continuation system, update docs

---

## 📊 What We Already Fixed

✅ **Environment variable override bug** (override=False → override=True)  
✅ **Schema validation warning** (union type syntax)  
✅ **WebSocket shim crash** (daemon restart + schema fix)  
✅ **Tool registry cleanup** (internal tools hidden)

**Result:** We already fixed 4 critical infrastructure bugs!
