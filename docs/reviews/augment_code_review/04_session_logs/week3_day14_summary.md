### Challenges Overcome

1. **UnifiedLogger API**
   - Initial tests used incorrect method signatures
   - Fixed by checking actual implementation
   - Lesson: Always verify API before writing tests

2. **Circuit Breaker Naming**
   - Circuit breaker uses function name, not custom name
   - Fixed by using correct function name in assertions
   - Lesson: Understand implementation details

3. **Progress Heartbeat Timing**
   - Initial test had timing issues with concurrent heartbeats
   - Fixed by adjusting intervals and expectations
   - Lesson: Be flexible with timing-sensitive tests
