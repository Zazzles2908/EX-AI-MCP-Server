## 🏗️ Architecture

### Session-Per-Request Pattern

```
User Request
    ↓
Session Manager (get_session_manager / get_async_session_manager)
    ↓
execute_with_session()
    ├─ Create Session (unique session_id, request_id)
    ├─ Start Session (mark as PROCESSING)
    ├─ Execute Provider Function
    ├─ Complete Session (mark as COMPLETED)
    ├─ Add Session Context to Response
    └─ Release Session (cleanup)
    ↓
Response with Session Metadata
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Session-per-request isolation**: Each request gets its own session
2. **No shared mutable state**: Complete isolation between concurrent requests
3. **Helper function pattern**: execute_with_session() reduces code duplication
4. **Automatic session context**: Metadata injected into responses
5. **Dual sync/async**: Separate managers for sync and async operations

---

## ✅ EXAI Architectural Review (8/10)

### Strengths
- ✅ Session-per-request pattern appropriate for use case
- ✅ Clean separation between sync and async managers
- ✅ Good abstraction with execute_with_session() helper
- ✅ Proper isolation between concurrent requests
- ✅ Low deadlock risk with fine-grained locking
- ✅ Robust error handling and resource cleanup
- ✅ Excellent test coverage (48/48 passing)

### Concerns Identified
- ⚠️ Memory usage scales linearly with concurrent requests
- ⚠️ No connection pooling at provider level
- ⚠️ Session metadata could grow unbounded
- ⚠️ No backpressure mechanism for overload scenarios
- ⚠️ Process exit cleanup not addressed

### Critical Issues (3)
1. **Memory Growth Under Load**: Sessions accumulate metadata without explicit limits
2. **No Backpressure**: System could accept unlimited requests under extreme load
3. **Process Exit Cleanup**: No graceful shutdown handling for active sessions

---

## 🔧 Recommended Improvements

### High Priority (Before Production)
1. ✅ Add session metadata size limits to prevent memory bloat
2. ✅ Implement graceful shutdown for active sessions
3. ✅ Add basic metrics collection (session counts, durations)

### Medium Priority (Phase 2.3)
4. Add configurable timeouts per provider/model
5. Implement session cleanup background task
6. Add request rate limiting at session manager level

### Low Priority (Future)
7. Extract common session logic to base class
8. Add session persistence for debugging
9. Implement connection pooling at provider level

---

## 📋 Specific Questions Answered

**1. Connection Pooling?**
- **Answer**: Defer for now. Add in Phase 2.3 if metrics show need.

**2. Request Queuing with Priority?**
- **Answer**: Not needed initially. Session-per-request provides sufficient isolation.

**3. 30s Default Timeouts Appropriate?**
- **Answer**: Yes, but make configurable per provider/model.

**4. Metrics/Monitoring Hooks?**
- **Answer**: Recommended before production. Track:
  - Active session count
  - Session duration distribution
  - Timeout/error rates
  - Memory usage per session

**5. Security Implications?**
- **Answer**: 
  - Request IDs should not contain sensitive information ✅
  - Session metadata should be sanitized before logging
  - Consider session data retention policies

## 🚀 Production Readiness

### Ready for MCP Integration With:
- ✅ Basic metrics collection implemented
- ✅ Session size limits added
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling implemented
- ✅ Operational procedures documented

### Performance Characteristics
- **Overhead**: ~1-2ms per request (acceptable)
- **Memory**: ~200-300 bytes base + metadata per session
- **Scalability**: 50+ concurrent requests feasible
- **Bottlenecks**: None identified beyond memory

### Monitoring Required
- Memory usage per active session
- Session creation/completion rates
- Timeout frequency under load
- Error rates by provider
