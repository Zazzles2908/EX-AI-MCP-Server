## Why were these files superseded?

The investigation produced many overlapping documents as findings evolved. To maintain clarity and prevent confusion, all findings have been consolidated into a single master checklist that:

1. **Eliminates duplication** - No conflicting information across multiple files
2. **Provides single source of truth** - One place to check current status
3. **Follows batch format** - Consistent with Batch 9 implementation plan structure
4. **Prioritizes actions** - Clear CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM priority levels
5. **Includes all findings** - Nothing lost, everything consolidated

---

## Can I delete these files?

**NO** - Keep them for historical reference. They document the investigation process and may be useful for:
- Understanding how conclusions were reached
- Reviewing EXAI consultation history
- Auditing the investigation process
- Learning from the evolution of findings

## How to use the consolidated checklist

See: `../CONSOLIDATED_MASTER_CHECKLIST.md`

This is now the single source of truth for all file upload system implementation work.
