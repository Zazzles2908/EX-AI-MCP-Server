        "details": "✅ COMPLETED: Successfully implemented all 5 file management components with full Moonshot storage integration!\n\n1. ✅ Cross-Platform File Registry - Complete file management with unique IDs, metadata storage, and Moonshot integration hooks\n2. ✅ File Health Check System - SHA-256 validation, storage monitoring, performance metrics with Supabase integration\n3. ✅ File Lifecycle Synchronization - Automated lifecycle management with cloud sync, retention policies, and backup workflows\n4. ✅ Error Recovery Manager - Circuit breaker pattern, automatic retry, rollback capabilities, and fallback storage\n5. ✅ Audit Trail Logging System - Enterprise-grade audit logging with compliance support and security event detection\n\nResults: Complete file management system ready for production use. All file uploads now use efficient native storage instead of chat token embedding.",
