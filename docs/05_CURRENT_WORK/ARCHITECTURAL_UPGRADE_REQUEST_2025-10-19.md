# Architectural Upgrade Request - Multi-Session & Async Operations
**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Affects System Performance  
**Status:** ðŸ”„ CONSULTATION IN PROGRESS

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

User has identified 4 critical architectural limitations that need addressing alongside the validated context engineering implementation:

1. **Multi-Session Parallelization** - Support concurrent connections without performance degradation
2. **Async Supabase Operations** - Non-blocking storage operations
3. **Documentation Organization** - Dedicated folder for context engineering docs
4. **Task Tracking in Supabase** - Persistent task management across sessions

---

## CURRENT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Infrastructure
- **Container:** Docker (WSL Linux), Python 3.11
- **Daemon:** Single WebSocket daemon on port 8079
- **Storage:** Dual (Supabase PostgreSQL + Redis cache)
- **AI Providers:** GLM-4.6, Kimi K2
- **Protocol:** MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### Performance Characteristics
- **API Response Time:** 1-2 seconds (fast)
- **Internal Data Flow:** 5-10+ seconds (slow)
- **Bottleneck:** Appears to be synchronous operations and blocking I/O

---

## UPGRADE 1: Multi-Session Parallelization

### Current Problem
**User's Observation:**
> "When two applications are both calling to EXAI at the same time, the runtime feels like it is extended. The API responses are pretty quick, but the information flowing internally feels slow."

**Symptoms:**
- Single daemon serves all connections
- 2+ concurrent connections cause significant delays
- API calls are fast, but internal processing is slow
- Unclear if this is concurrency issue or resource contention

### Proposed Solution
- Support multiple independent concurrent sessions
- Each connection gets unique session ID
- Sessions work in parallel without blocking each other
- Sessions can be interconnected when needed (shared context)

### Architecture Questions
1. **Daemon Architecture:**
   - Option A: One daemon with session multiplexing (asyncio)
   - Option B: Multiple daemon instances (one per session)
   - Option C: Hybrid (one daemon, worker pool for heavy ops)

2. **API Key Management:**
   - Can one API key handle concurrent requests?
   - Do we need separate keys per session?

3. **Resource Sharing:**
   - How to handle shared Redis/Supabase connections?
   - Connection pooling strategy?

4. **Root Cause:**
   - Is the slowdown from I/O blocking, sync operations, or resource contention?

---

## UPGRADE 2: Async Supabase Operations

### Current Problem
**User's Insight:**
> "Information stored into Supabase during this process doesn't technically need to work concurrently with the operations, because it is just baseline of everything, so it isn't dependent on its operations."

**Symptoms:**
- Supabase writes happen synchronously during tool execution
- Blocks main request/response flow
- Storage is "baseline tracking" - not critical for immediate response
- Adds unnecessary latency to every operation

### Proposed Solution
- Make Supabase operations fully asynchronous
- Don't block tool execution waiting for storage confirmation
- Maintain eventual consistency
- Handle storage failures gracefully without affecting user experience

### Architecture Questions
1. **Async Pattern:**
   - Full asyncio conversion (async/await throughout)?
   - Threading for I/O operations (Supabase, Redis)?
   - Celery/RQ for background tasks?
   - Hybrid (sync MCP interface, async internals)?

2. **MCP Protocol Compatibility:**
   - MCP is synchronous - how to integrate async operations?
   - Should we wrap async operations in sync interface?

3. **Data Consistency:**
   - How to ensure consistency across parallel sessions?
   - Should we batch writes for efficiency?
   - How to handle write failures?

4. **Performance Impact:**
   - Expected latency reduction?
   - Will this solve the "slow internal flow" issue?

## UPGRADE 3: Documentation Organization

### Current Problem
**User's Request:**
> "With all these markdown files, we should have this vital information in its own separate folder, instead under project status, so we don't have it lost."

**Current State:**
- Context engineering docs in `docs/05_CURRENT_WORK/05_PROJECT_STATUS/`
- 40+ files in that directory
- Critical architectural docs mixed with general project status
- Risk of getting lost or overlooked

### Proposed Solution
- Create dedicated folder for context engineering implementation
- Separate from general project status
- Clear organization structure

### Organization Questions
1. **Folder Structure:**
   - `docs/06_CONTEXT_ENGINEERING/`?
   - `docs/ARCHITECTURE/CONTEXT_ENGINEERING/`?
   - `docs/IMPLEMENTATION/CONTEXT_ENGINEERING/`?

2. **Internal Organization:**
   - By phase (Phase1/, Phase2/, Phase3/, Phase4/)?
   - By component (detection/, storage/, testing/, monitoring/)?
   - Chronologically (2025-10-19/, 2025-10-20/, etc.)?
   - Hybrid (phases with components inside)?

3. **Versioning:**
   - Should we version these docs (v1/, v2/)?
   - How to track changes and iterations?

---

## UPGRADE 4: Task Tracking in Supabase

### Current Problem
**User's Request:**
> "We should have this also stored in Supabase knowing this is an active task to complete."

**Current State:**
- Tasks only exist in conversation memory
- Lost when conversation ends
- Lost on Docker restart
- No persistent task history
- No multi-session task coordination

### Proposed Solution
- Store active tasks in Supabase
- Track task state, progress, completion
- Enable task recovery after restarts
- Support multi-session task coordination

### Architecture Questions
1. **Schema Design:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id TEXT,  -- or NULL for global tasks
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    state TEXT CHECK (state IN ('NOT_STARTED', 'IN_PROGRESS', 'CANCELLED', 'COMPLETE')),
    parent_task_id UUID REFERENCES tasks(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    metadata JSONB
);
```

2. **Sync Strategy:**
   - Real-time sync (every task update)?
   - Periodic sync (every 30s)?
   - On-demand sync (user-triggered)?
   - Hybrid (immediate for critical, periodic for others)?

3. **Session Scope:**
   - Session-specific tasks (isolated per connection)?
   - Global tasks (shared across all sessions)?
   - Hybrid (both types with clear distinction)?

4. **Conflict Resolution:**
   - How to handle concurrent updates to same task?
   - Last-write-wins?
   - Optimistic locking with version numbers?
   - Conflict detection and user notification?

## INTEGRATION WITH CONTEXT ENGINEERING

### Current Context Engineering Plan
- **Phase 1 (Week 1):** Defense-in-depth history stripping - 99% token reduction
- **Phase 2 (Week 2):** Compaction with importance scoring
- **Phase 3 (Week 3):** Structured note-taking
- **Phase 4 (Week 4):** Progressive file disclosure

### Integration Questions
1. **Priority:** Which upgrades should we implement first?
2. **Parallelization:** Can upgrades be implemented alongside context engineering phases?
3. **Timeline Impact:** Does this extend the 4-week plan?
4. **Dependencies:** Do any upgrades depend on context engineering completion?

### Proposed Integration Strategy
**Option A: Sequential**
- Complete context engineering first (4 weeks)
- Then implement architectural upgrades (2-3 weeks)
- Total: 6-7 weeks

**Option B: Parallel**
- Week 1: Context Eng Phase 1 + Documentation Organization
- Week 2: Context Eng Phase 2 + Async Supabase
- Week 3: Context Eng Phase 3 + Task Tracking
- Week 4: Context Eng Phase 4 + Multi-Session
- Total: 4 weeks (aggressive)

**Option C: Hybrid**
- Week 1: Context Eng Phase 1 (CRITICAL)
- Week 2: Async Supabase + Documentation Org (enables faster development)
- Week 3: Context Eng Phase 2 + Task Tracking
- Week 4: Context Eng Phase 3
- Week 5: Multi-Session Parallelization
- Week 6: Context Eng Phase 4
- Total: 6 weeks (balanced)

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### High Risks
1. **Breaking Existing Functionality**
   - Multi-session changes could break single-session use cases
   - Async operations could introduce race conditions
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing, feature flags, gradual rollout

2. **Data Consistency Issues**
   - Async Supabase writes could lose data on failures
   - Concurrent sessions could corrupt shared state
   - Mitigation: Idempotent operations, retry logic, conflict detection

3. **Performance Degradation**
   - Poorly implemented async could be slower than sync
   - Connection pooling overhead
   - Mitigation: Benchmarking, profiling, load testing

### Medium Risks
1. **Increased Complexity**
   - Async code is harder to debug
   - Multi-session coordination adds complexity
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive logging, monitoring, documentation

2. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Existing conversations might not work with new system
   - Task format changes
   - Mitigation: Migration scripts, version detection, fallback logic

## TESTING STRATEGY

### Multi-Session Testing
1. **Concurrent Connection Test**
   - Launch 2-5 simultaneous connections
   - Measure response times, throughput
   - Verify session isolation

2. **Shared Resource Test**
   - Multiple sessions accessing same conversation
   - Verify no race conditions or data corruption

3. **Load Test**
   - Sustained concurrent load (1 hour+)
   - Monitor memory leaks, connection exhaustion

### Async Operations Testing
1. **Failure Scenarios**
   - Supabase connection loss during write
   - Redis unavailable
   - Verify graceful degradation

2. **Consistency Verification**
   - Compare async writes with expected state
   - Verify eventual consistency guarantees

3. **Performance Benchmarking**
