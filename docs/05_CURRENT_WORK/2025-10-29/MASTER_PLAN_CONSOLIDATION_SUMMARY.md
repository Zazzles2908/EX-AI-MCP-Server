- 🟢 **Medium:** 3 tasks (Advanced features, dead code, architecture consolidation)
- ⚪ **Low:** 3 tasks (Production readiness, smart file query, file generation system)

**Total:** 12 major tasks with clear priorities

---

### **3. EXAI File Generation System Designed** ✅
**Location:** `docs/05_CURRENT_WORK/2025-10-29/EXAI_FILE_GENERATION_SYSTEM.md`

**Architecture Highlights:**
- ✅ **Storage:** Supabase buckets (leveraging existing Pro subscription)
- ✅ **Generation Flow:** EXAI → Generator → Supabase → File ID
- ✅ **Retrieval Flow:** Client → Retriever → Supabase → Stream Response
- ✅ **Components:** FileGenerator, TemplateEngine, FileRetriever, MCP tools
- ✅ **Database Schema:** Complete schema for generated_files table

**Implementation Plan:**
- **Phase 1:** Foundation (1 day) - Database, storage bucket, basic generator
- **Phase 2:** Core Features (2 days) - Retrieval, MCP tools, templates, AI generation
- **Phase 3:** Advanced Features (1 day) - Versioning, batch ops, dashboard
- **Phase 4:** Security & Performance (1 day) - Rate limiting, access controls, caching

**Total Effort:** 5 days for complete implementation

**Use Cases:**
1. Generate master checklists from multiple documents
2. Create comprehensive reports from system data
3. Generate configuration files from templates
4. Auto-generate documentation from code analysis
5. Export data in various formats (CSV, JSON, YAML)
6. Generate boilerplate code from templates
7. Create test data files

---

### **4. Old Master Plan Archived** ✅
**Action:** Renamed `MASTER_PLAN__TESTING_AND_CLEANUP.md` to `ARCHIVED__MASTER_PLAN__TESTING_AND_CLEANUP.md`

**Rationale:**
- Old plan had duplicate tasks across multiple documents
- Tasks were not prioritized or organized
- No clear execution order
- Mixed completed and pending tasks
- New master checklist is cleaner and more actionable

---
