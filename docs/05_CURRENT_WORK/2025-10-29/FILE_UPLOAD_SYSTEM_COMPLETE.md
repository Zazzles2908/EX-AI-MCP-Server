**Status:** FULLY OPERATIONAL & SECURITY HARDENED
**Validation:** Both Kimi and GLM platforms tested end-to-end
**Security:** Path traversal protection, centralized validation, 4-layer defense system

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS (2025-10-28)**

The file upload system now includes comprehensive security hardening:

**‚úÖ Path Traversal Protection**
- Detects and blocks attempts like `/mnt/project/../../../etc/passwd`
- Normalizes paths and validates they remain within `/mnt/project/`
- Prevents access to system files outside the mount point

**‚úÖ Centralized Validation (`utils/path_validation.py`)**
- Single source of truth for all path validation logic
- Comprehensive checks: Windows paths, relative paths, path traversal, empty paths, path length
- Consistent error messages across all tools

**‚úÖ 4-Layer Defense System**
1. **Tool Schemas**: Pattern validation `^/mnt/project/.*` with explicit requirements
2. **System Prompts**: Comprehensive Docker context explanation
3. **Agent Rules**: Correct examples, Windows ‚Üí Linux path mapping
4. **Runtime Validation**: Centralized validation before any file operations

**‚úÖ Comprehensive Error Messages**
- Explains WHAT is wrong (specific violation)
- Explains WHY it's wrong (Docker context)
- Shows HOW to fix it (correct format example)
- Provides quick fix guidance

## üöÄ Quick Start (For New Agents)

**If you're new and just want to upload a file, here's what you need to know:**

### The One Thing You MUST Know

**Use Linux container paths, not Windows paths!**

```
‚ùå WRONG: "c:\\Project\\file.txt"
‚úÖ RIGHT: "/mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/file.txt"
```

### 3-Step Upload Process

**Step 1: Upload File**
```json
Tool: kimi_upload_files
{
  "files": ["/mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/your_file.txt"]
}
‚Üí Returns: {"file_id": "abc123..."}
```

**Step 2: Chat with File**
```json
Tool: kimi_chat_with_files
{
  "prompt": "Summarize this file",
  "file_ids": ["abc123..."]
}
‚Üí Returns: AI analysis of your file
```

**Step 3: Done!** üéâ

### Path Conversion Cheat Sheet

```
Your Windows Path              ‚Üí  Use This in Tools
c:\Project\EX-AI-MCP-Server\   ‚Üí  /mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/
c:\Project\Personal_AI_Agent\  ‚Üí  /mnt/project/Personal_AI_Agent/
c:\Project\anything\           ‚Üí  /mnt/project/anything/
```

**Why?** The system runs in Docker. Only `c:\Project\` is mounted to `/mnt/project/` in the container.

### üîç Environment Verification (Run This First!)

**Before your first upload, verify the environment:**

```python
# Check if you're in the container
import os
print(f"Working directory: {os.getcwd()}")
print(f"Mount point exists: {os.path.exists('/mnt/project/')}")

# List available directories
if os.path.exists('/mnt/project/'):
    print(f"Available: {os.listdir('/mnt/project/')}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Working directory: /app
Mount point exists: True
Available: ['EX-AI-MCP-Server', 'Personal_AI_Agent', ...]
```

**If `/mnt/project/` doesn't exist:** Docker volume mount is not configured. Contact system administrator.

### ‚úÖ Path Validation Helper

**Use this to validate paths before uploading:**

```python
def validate_upload_path(file_path: str) -> str:
    """Validate and normalize file path for container upload"""
    import os

    # Check for Windows paths
    if not file_path.startswith('/mnt/project/'):
        if ':' in file_path or '\\' in file_path:
            raise ValueError(
                f"‚ùå Windows path detected: {file_path}\n"
                f"‚úÖ Use Linux path instead: /mnt/project/..."
            )
        raise ValueError(f"Path must start with /mnt/project/, got: {file_path}")

    # Check file exists
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(
            f"‚ùå File not found: {file_path}\n"
            f"Verify file exists on Windows host and Docker mount is working"
        )

    return file_path

# Usage:
validated_path = validate_upload_path("/mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/file.txt")
kimi_upload_files(files=[validated_path])
```

## üìù Usage Examples - FRESH AGENT PERSPECTIVE

### üö® CRITICAL PATH DISCOVERY

**What a new agent sees when trying to upload files:**

#### ‚ùå Common Mistakes (What DOESN'T Work)
```
# Attempt 1: Windows path
kimi_upload_files(files=["c:\\Project\\file.txt"])
‚ùå ERROR: All files were skipped. Skipped files: ['/app/file.txt']

# Attempt 2: Relative path
kimi_upload_files(files=["test_file.txt"])
‚ùå ERROR: No valid files to process after path normalization

# Attempt 3: Windows path with forward slashes
kimi_upload_files(files=["C:/Project/file.txt"])
‚ùå ERROR: All files were skipped. Skipped files: ['/app/file.txt']
```

**Why these fail:** The system runs in a Docker container. Windows paths get converted to `/app/` which doesn't have your files.

#### ‚úÖ What WORKS (The Solution)

**Use Linux container paths directly:**
```
# Correct path format for files in c:\Project\
kimi_upload_files(files=["/mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/test_file.txt"])
‚úÖ SUCCESS: {"file_id": "d40jhqc5rbs2bc4qfe50", "filename": "test_file.txt"}
```

**Path Mapping Reference:**
```
Windows Host          ‚Üí  Docker Container
c:\Project\           ‚Üí  /mnt/project/
c:\Project\EX-AI-MCP-Server\file.txt  ‚Üí  /mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/file.txt
c:\Project\Personal_AI_Agent\data.json  ‚Üí  /mnt/project/Personal_AI_Agent/data.json
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: "All files were skipped"

**Error Message:**
```
All files were skipped. Skipped files: ['/app/test_file.txt']
```

**Cause:** You're using Windows paths, but the system runs in Docker and converts them to `/app/` which doesn't have your files.

**Solution:** Use Linux container paths instead:
```
‚ùå Wrong: "c:\\Project\\file.txt"
‚úÖ Right: "/mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/file.txt"
```

### Problem: "No valid files to process"

**Error Message:**
```
No valid files to process after path normalization
```

**Cause:** Relative paths don't work because the container's working directory is different from your Windows directory.

**Solution:** Always use absolute Linux paths starting with `/mnt/project/`

### Problem: "File too large"

**Error Message:**
```
File too large: 150000000 bytes (max 100MB for Kimi)
```

**Cause:** File exceeds platform limits.

**Solution:**
- Kimi: Max 100MB per file
- GLM: Max 20MB per file
- Split large files or use a different platform

### Problem: "File not found"

**Error Message:**
```
FileNotFoundError: /mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/missing.txt
```

**Cause:** File doesn't exist at the specified path in the container.

**Solution:**
1. Verify file exists on Windows host: `c:\Project\EX-AI-MCP-Server\missing.txt`
2. Check Docker volume mount is working: `docker exec exai-mcp-daemon ls /mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/`
3. Ensure file is under `c:\Project\` directory (only this directory is mounted)

### Problem: "Deduplication - file already uploaded"

**Response:**
```json
{"file_id": "...", "filename": "...", "deduplicated": true}
```

**This is NOT an error!** The system detected you already uploaded this exact file (SHA256 match) and returned the existing file_id. This saves time and storage.

**What to do:** Use the returned file_id normally - it works the same as a fresh upload.

### Problem: "How do I know what files I've uploaded?"

**Solution:** Use the file management tool:
```json
// Tool: kimi_manage_files
{
  "operation": "list",
  "limit": 100
}

// Returns: List of all uploaded files with IDs, names, sizes, dates
```

### Problem: "How do I delete uploaded files?"

**Solution:**
```json
// Tool: kimi_manage_files
{
  "operation": "delete",
  "file_id": "d40jhqc5rbs2bc4qfe50"
}

// Or cleanup all files:
{
  "operation": "cleanup_all",
  "dry_run": true  // Preview first, then set to false
}
```

### Problem: "Permission denied"

**Error Message:**
```
PermissionError: Permission denied when reading /mnt/project/file.txt
```

**Cause:** File permissions issue in Docker container.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check file permissions
docker exec exai-mcp-daemon ls -la /mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/file.txt

# If needed, fix permissions on Windows host
# (Run as Administrator)
icacls "c:\Project\EX-AI-MCP-Server\file.txt" /grant Everyone:R
```

### Problem: "Directory /mnt/project/ does not exist"

**Error Message:**
```
FileNotFoundError: Directory /mnt/project/ does not exist
```

**Cause:** Docker volume mount not configured.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify Docker volume mount
docker inspect exai-mcp-daemon | findstr /C:"Mounts"

# Expected output should include:
# "Source": "c:\\Project",
# "Destination": "/mnt/project"

# If missing, check docker-compose.yml:
volumes:
  - c:\Project:/mnt/project:ro
```

### Problem: "Upload timeout"

**Error Message:**
```
TimeoutError: Upload exceeded 120 seconds
```

**Cause:** Large file upload taking too long.

**Solution:**
- Check file size (Kimi: 100MB max, GLM: 20MB max)
- Compress file before uploading
- Check network connection
- For very large files, consider splitting into chunks

### Quick Diagnostic Checklist

1. ‚úÖ **Is file under `c:\Project\`?** Only this directory is mounted to Docker
2. ‚úÖ **Using Linux path format?** Must start with `/mnt/project/`
3. ‚úÖ **File size within limits?** Kimi: 100MB, GLM: 20MB
4. ‚úÖ **File exists?** Check with `docker exec exai-mcp-daemon ls /mnt/project/...`
5. ‚úÖ **Correct tool?** `kimi_upload_files` for Kimi, `glm_upload_file` for GLM
6. ‚úÖ **Permissions OK?** Check with `docker exec exai-mcp-daemon ls -la /mnt/project/...`
7. ‚úÖ **Volume mounted?** Verify with `docker inspect exai-mcp-daemon`
