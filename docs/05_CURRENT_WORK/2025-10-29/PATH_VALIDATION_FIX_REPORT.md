# Path Validation Fix Report - External AI Agent Support

**Date:** 2025-10-29 10:52 AEDT  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE & DEPLOYED  
**Issue:** External AI agents failing with FileNotFoundError  
**Root Cause:** Unclear path requirements and unhelpful error messages

---

## üîç **PROBLEM DISCOVERY**

### **User Report:**
> "I tried to get another AI to try use your system, but unfortunately it failed straight away"

### **Error from Docker Logs:**
```
2025-10-29 10:49:57 ERROR tools.smart_file_query: [SMART_FILE_QUERY] execute() failed: 
File not found: /mnt/project/Mum/Documents/Incident Reports/9552610 SE9552610_Workplace Harassment_2025-02-28.pdf

FileNotFoundError: File not found: /mnt/project/Mum/Documents/Incident Reports/9552610 SE9552610_Workplace Harassment_2025-02-28.pdf
```

### **Pattern:**
External AI tried to access multiple files:
- `/mnt/project/Mum/Documents/Incident Reports/9552610 SE9552610_Workplace Harassment_2025-02-28.pdf`
- `/mnt/project/Mum/Documents/Incident Reports/9556994 SE9556994_Workplace Anxiety and Panic Incident_2025-04-01.pdf`
- `/mnt/project/Mum/Documents/Incident Reports/9557049 SE9557049_Workplace Meeting and Work Assignment_2025-04-16.pdf`
- `/mnt/project/Mum/Documents/Incident Reports/9579147 SE9579147_Workplace Confidentiality Breach Incident_2025-04-14.pdf`

All failed with the same error.

## üéØ **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **1. Docker Volume Mounts (from docker-compose.yml):**
```yaml
volumes:
  # Maps c:\Project to /mnt/project (read-only)
  - c:\Project:/mnt/project:ro
```

**What This Means:**
- ‚úÖ `/mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/*` is accessible (maps to `c:\Project\EX-AI-MCP-Server\`)
- ‚úÖ `/mnt/project/Personal_AI_Agent/*` is accessible (maps to `c:\Project\Personal_AI_Agent\`)
- ‚ùå `/mnt/project/Mum/*` is NOT accessible (would require `c:\Project\Mum\` to exist)

### **2. Tool Description Was Unclear:**
**Old Description:**
```
Example: smart_file_query(file_path="/mnt/project/...", question="Analyze this code")
```

**Problem:** Didn't specify which paths are actually accessible!

### **3. Input Schema Pattern Was Too Permissive:**
**Old Pattern:**
```json
"pattern": "^/mnt/project/.*"
```

**Problem:** Allowed ANY path under `/mnt/project/`, even if not accessible!

### **4. Error Messages Were Unhelpful:**
**Old Error:**
```
FileNotFoundError: File not found: /mnt/project/Mum/Documents/file.pdf
```

**Problem:** Didn't explain WHY the file wasn't found or what paths ARE accessible!

---

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Updated Tool Description**
**New Description:**
```python
"""
Unified file upload and query interface with automatic deduplication and provider selection.

USE THIS TOOL for ALL file operations instead of individual upload/chat tools.

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PATH REQUIREMENTS:
- Files MUST exist within the mounted project directory
- Accessible paths: /mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/*, /mnt/project/Personal_AI_Agent/*
- Files outside these directories are NOT accessible
- If you need to analyze external files, they must be copied into the project first

Features:
- Automatic SHA256-based deduplication (reuses existing uploads)
- Intelligent provider selection (file size + user preference)
- Automatic fallback (GLM fails ‚Üí Kimi, vice versa)
- Centralized Supabase tracking
- Path validation and security checks

Example: smart_file_query(file_path="/mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/src/file.py", question="Analyze this code")
"""
```

### **2. Updated Input Schema Pattern**
**New Pattern:**
```json
{
    "file_path": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "REQUIRED. Absolute Linux path to file within mounted directories. MUST start with /mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/ or /mnt/project/Personal_AI_Agent/. Files outside these directories are NOT accessible. Windows paths NOT supported.",
        "pattern": "^/mnt/project/(EX-AI-MCP-Server|Personal_AI_Agent)/.*"
    }
}
```

### **3. Improved Error Messages**
**New Error:**
```python
if not os.path.exists(file_path):
    accessible_paths = [
        "/mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/",
        "/mnt/project/Personal_AI_Agent/"
    ]
    error_msg = (
        f"File not found: {file_path}\n\n"
        f"‚ö†Ô∏è ACCESSIBLE PATHS:\n"
        f"  ‚Ä¢ {accessible_paths[0]}* (EX-AI-MCP-Server project)\n"
        f"  ‚Ä¢ {accessible_paths[1]}* (Personal AI Agent project)\n\n"
        f"üí° TIP: Files outside these directories are NOT accessible.\n"
        f"   If you need to analyze external files, copy them into one of these directories first."
    )
    raise FileNotFoundError(error_msg)
```

### **4. Updated System Prompt Guidance**
**New Guidance (configurations/file_handling_guidance.py):**
```python
SMART_FILE_QUERY_GUIDANCE = """
SMART FILE QUERY - UNIFIED FILE OPERATIONS

üéØ PRIMARY INTERFACE for all file upload and query operations

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: FILES MUST EXIST IN ACCESSIBLE DIRECTORIES
‚Ä¢ ACCESSIBLE: /mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/* (main project)
‚Ä¢ ACCESSIBLE: /mnt/project/Personal_AI_Agent/* (AI agent project)
‚Ä¢ NOT ACCESSIBLE: Any other paths (e.g., /mnt/project/Mum/*, /mnt/project/Documents/*)
‚Ä¢ If you need to analyze external files, copy them into an accessible directory first
...
"""
```

---

## üìä **BEFORE vs AFTER**

### **BEFORE:**
```
External AI: "Let me analyze /mnt/project/Mum/Documents/file.pdf"
System: "FileNotFoundError: File not found: /mnt/project/Mum/Documents/file.pdf"
External AI: "Hmm, let me try another path..."
System: "FileNotFoundError: File not found: /mnt/project/Mum/Documents/file2.pdf"
External AI: "This system doesn't work!"
```

### **AFTER:**
```
External AI: "Let me analyze /mnt/project/Mum/Documents/file.pdf"
System: "File not found: /mnt/project/Mum/Documents/file.pdf

‚ö†Ô∏è ACCESSIBLE PATHS:
  ‚Ä¢ /mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/* (EX-AI-MCP-Server project)
  ‚Ä¢ /mnt/project/Personal_AI_Agent/* (Personal AI Agent project)

üí° TIP: Files outside these directories are NOT accessible.
   If you need to analyze external files, copy them into one of these directories first."

External AI: "Oh! I need to copy the file first. Let me do that..."
```

## ‚úÖ **VALIDATION**

### **Docker Container:**
- ‚úÖ Rebuilt successfully (no cache)
- ‚úÖ All services running
- ‚úÖ No build errors
- ‚úÖ No runtime errors

### **Code Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Tool description updated
- ‚úÖ Input schema pattern updated
- ‚úÖ Error messages improved
- ‚úÖ System prompt guidance updated

### **Testing:**
- ‚è≥ Awaiting external AI agent test
- ‚è≥ User to confirm fix works

---

## üéØ **HOW EXTERNAL AGENTS SHOULD USE IT NOW**

### **Step 1: Check if file is in accessible directory**
```
Is the file in /mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/* or /mnt/project/Personal_AI_Agent/*?
  ‚úÖ YES ‚Üí Proceed to Step 2
  ‚ùå NO ‚Üí Copy file to accessible directory first
```

### **Step 2: Call smart_file_query**
```python
result = await smart_file_query.execute({
    "file_path": "/mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/src/file.py",
    "question": "What does this code do?"
})
```

### **Step 3: Handle response**
```python
# Success response
{
    "status": "success",
    "content": "Analysis result here...",
    "content_type": "text"
}

# Error response (with helpful guidance)
{
    "status": "error",
    "content": "File not found: /mnt/project/Mum/Documents/file.pdf\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è ACCESSIBLE PATHS:...",
    "content_type": "text"
}
```

---

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate (User Action Required):**
1. **Test with external AI agent** to confirm fix works
2. **Verify error messages** are helpful and clear
3. **Report any remaining issues**

### **If External AI Still Fails:**
1. Check Docker logs for new error patterns
2. Verify file paths are correct
3. Confirm files exist in accessible directories
4. Report specific error messages

**All work completed autonomously as requested.** ‚úÖ

**The system now provides clear guidance to external AI agents!** üöÄ

**Please test with an external AI agent to confirm the fix works!** üîÑ
