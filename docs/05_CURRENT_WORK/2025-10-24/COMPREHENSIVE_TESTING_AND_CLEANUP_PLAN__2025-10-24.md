| Phase 5: Architecture Consolidation | 1.5 days | Phase 4 complete | +0.25 day |

**EXAI Consultation Points:** After each phase (6 total including Phase 0)

**Monitoring Overhead Breakdown:**
- Setup Time: 0.5 day initial + 0.25 day per phase = 1.75 days total
- Execution Overhead: 5-10% performance impact during testing
- Analysis Time: 0.5 day per phase for metrics review = 3 days total
- Documentation: 0.25 day per phase for findings = 1.5 days total

**Timeline Comparison:**
- Original Plan: 5-7 days (no monitoring)
- Enhanced Plan: 10.5 days (with Phase 0 + continuous monitoring)
- Additional Investment: 3.5-5.5 days for comprehensive monitoring and baselines

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues and Mitigations

**1. WebSocket Daemon Instability**
- **Risk:** Daemon crashes during testing
- **Mitigation:** Implement retry logic and connection validation
- **Backup:** Direct MCP server testing if daemon fails

**2. API Rate Limiting**
- **Risk:** Hit rate limits during extensive testing
- **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting in test scripts
- **Backup:** Use test credentials with higher limits

**3. Tool Failures Causing Cascade Issues**
- **Risk:** One tool failure breaks subsequent tests
- **Mitigation:** Isolate tool testing environments
- **Backup:** Implement circuit breakers in test framework

**4. Performance Testing Inconsistencies**
- **Risk:** High variance in performance measurements
- **Mitigation:** Multiple test runs with statistical analysis
- **Backup:** Controlled test environment with consistent resources
