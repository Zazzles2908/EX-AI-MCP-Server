# Phase 3A: Critical Stress Test Results - CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

**Created:** 2025-10-26 17:30 AEDT
**Duration:** 3 hours
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED - TESTING PAUSED
**EXAI Consultation:** c657a995-0f0d-4b97-91be-2618055313f4 (Turn 11/14)

---

## üéØ **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Tests Completed:** 3/3 (Connection Pool, Heavy Tools, Concurrent Scaling)
**Critical Issues Found:** 4 (2 Critical, 2 High, 0 Medium)
**Recommendation:** **STOP TESTING - FIX CRITICAL ISSUES FIRST**

**EXAI Verdict:**
> "The current test data is INVALID because the chat tool isn't actually calling the AI model. You're testing a mock system, not the real one. Fix Issues 1 and 2 first before proceeding."

---

## ‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **Issue 1: Chat Tool Not Calling AI Model - CRITICAL**

**Severity:** üî¥ **CRITICAL** (Blocks all meaningful testing)

**Evidence:**
- Chat tool latency: 0.6-0.8 ms
- Status tool latency: 0.86 ms
- **Expected:** Chat should be 10-100x slower (10-100ms) due to AI processing
- **Actual:** SAME SPEED as status tool!

**Root Cause (EXAI Analysis):**
> "The 0.6-0.8ms latency indicates it's not making real API calls. Likely using cached responses or mock mode."

**Impact:**
- ‚ùå All "heavy tool" performance data is INVALID
- ‚ùå Cannot establish realistic production baselines
- ‚ùå Testing mock system, not real system

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Check for "mock mode" or "cache mode" enabled
2. Force real API calls with unique, non-cacheable prompts
3. Add logging to verify actual API calls
4. Use parameters that bypass caching (temperature=1.0, unique prompts)

**Priority:** **#1 - MUST FIX BEFORE ANY FURTHER TESTING**

---

### **Issue 2: Connection Limit Too Low (10 per IP) - HIGH**

**Severity:** üü† **HIGH** (Blocks realistic concurrent testing)

**Evidence:**
- Attempted: 10, 25, 50 concurrent connections
- Successful: Only 7/10 connections
- Error: "Too many connections from your IP (10/10)"

**Root Cause (EXAI Analysis):**
> "The MCP server has a hard-coded connection limit of 10 per IP address, preventing realistic concurrent testing."

**Impact:**
- ‚ùå Cannot test realistic production scenarios (50-100+ users)
- ‚ùå Cannot measure system behavior under real load
- ‚ùå Cannot identify breaking points

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Increase limit to 50-100 for development/testing
2. Add configuration parameter for connection limits
3. Different limits for dev vs production

**Priority:** **#2 - FIX AFTER ISSUE 1**

---

### **Issue 3: Throughput Degradation Under Concurrency - MEDIUM**

**Severity:** üü° **MEDIUM** (Performance concern)

**Evidence:**
- 5 clients: 288 msg/s
- 10 clients (7 connected): 397 msg/s
- **Expected:** 2x throughput (576 msg/s)
- **Actual:** 1.4x throughput (397 msg/s)
- **Scaling efficiency:** 69% (target: 80-90%)

**Root Cause (EXAI Analysis):**
> "Resource contention (likely CPU or I/O bound) preventing linear scaling. Could be thread pool saturation, database connection limits, or CPU contention."

**Impact:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è System doesn't scale linearly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May struggle under production load
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Indicates bottleneck in shared resources

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Profile CPU usage during concurrent tests
2. Check thread pool configurations
3. Investigate blocking I/O operations

**Priority:** **#3 - INVESTIGATE AFTER ISSUES 1 & 2**

---

### **Issue 4: Latency Increase Under Concurrency - MEDIUM**

**Severity:** üü° **MEDIUM** (User experience concern)

**Evidence:**
- 5 clients: 1.81ms avg, 2.76ms P95
- 10 clients: 3.34ms avg, 8.01ms P95
- **Latency increase:** 1.8x for 2x clients
- **P95 increase:** 2.9x (concerning!)

**Root Cause (EXAI Analysis):**
> "Same resource contention causing throughput degradation. P95 latency jumping from 2.76ms to 8.01ms suggests queue buildup."

**Impact:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User experience degrades with more clients
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Queue buildup indicates system struggling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May cause timeout issues under load

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Same as Issue 3 - resolve resource contention
2. Implement request prioritization or load shedding

**Priority:** **#4 - INVESTIGATE AFTER ISSUES 1 & 2**

## üìä **DETAILED TEST RESULTS**

### **Test 1: Connection Pool Stress ‚úÖ PASSED (with concerns)**

**Metrics:**
- Total cycles: 15
- Memory growth: 10.36 MB (0.69 MB per cycle)
- File descriptors: Stable (no leaks)
- Connections per cycle: 7/10 successful (limited by server)

**Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ No significant memory leaks (<5MB per cycle threshold)
- ‚úÖ No file descriptor leaks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Connection limit prevents realistic testing

---

### **Test 2: Heavy Tool Performance ‚ùå FAILED (Invalid Data)**

**Metrics:**
- Small prompt (100 chars): 0.82ms avg, 1,220 msg/s
- Medium prompt (500 chars): 0.64ms avg, 1,567 msg/s
- Large prompt (1KB): 0.63ms avg, 1,580 msg/s

**Analysis:**
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL:** Chat tool NOT calling AI model
- ‚ùå Performance identical to status tool (should be 10-100x slower)
- ‚ùå All data INVALID for production baseline

**Expected Performance (Real AI Calls):**
- Small prompt: 10-50ms avg, 20-100 msg/s
- Medium prompt: 50-200ms avg, 5-20 msg/s
- Large prompt: 100-500ms avg, 2-10 msg/s

- 10 clients (7 connected): 397 msg/s, 3.34ms avg, 8.01ms P95
- Scaling efficiency: 69% (target: 80-90%)

**Analysis:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Throughput degradation (69% efficiency)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Latency increase (1.8x for 2x clients)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è P95 latency increase (2.9x - concerning!)

## üîç **EXAI ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **Why Chat Tool Isn't Calling AI:**

**EXAI's Analysis:**
> "The 0.6-0.8ms latency is impossible for real AI processing (network + model inference). Chat and status tools having identical performance confirms they're doing similar work."

**Possible Causes:**
1. Mock mode enabled in development
2. Response caching enabled
3. Tool returning default/cached response
4. API call not being made

**How to Verify:**
1. Add logging to track actual API calls
2. Use unique prompts with timestamps
3. Set `temperature=1.0` to bypass caching
4. Check for "mock" or "test" mode flags

---

### **Why Throughput Degrades:**

**EXAI's Analysis:**
> "69% scaling efficiency suggests bottleneck in shared resources. Could be thread pool saturation, database connection limits, or CPU contention."

**Possible Causes:**
1. Thread pool exhaustion
2. CPU saturation
3. Blocking I/O operations
4. Database connection limits
5. Lock contention

**How to Investigate:**
1. Profile CPU usage during tests
2. Monitor thread pool utilization
3. Check for blocking operations
4. Analyze queue depths
