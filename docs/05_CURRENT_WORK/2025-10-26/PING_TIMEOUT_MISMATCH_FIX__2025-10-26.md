# WebSocket Ping Timeout Mismatch Fix - 2025-10-26

## üéØ Root Cause Identified

**Problem:** Connections cycling every 10-30 seconds due to ping/pong timeout mismatches between daemon and shim.

### Evidence from Docker Logs

```
19:33:17 - vscode-instance-1 connects (session created)
19:33:17 - vscode-instance-2 connects (session created)
19:33:27 - vscode-instance-1 DISCONNECTS (duration: 10.43s) ‚ùå
19:33:27 - vscode-instance-1 reconnects
19:33:27 - vscode-instance-2 reconnects
```

**Pattern:** Connections disconnect and reconnect every 10-30 seconds, causing both VSCode instances to show red dots.

## üîç Configuration Mismatch Analysis

### Daemon Configuration (.env.docker)
```bash
EXAI_WS_PING_INTERVAL=45  # Daemon expects pings every 45 seconds
EXAI_WS_PING_TIMEOUT=240  # Daemon waits 240 seconds for ping response
```

### Shim Configuration (.env) - BEFORE FIX
```bash
EXAI_WS_PING_INTERVAL=30  # ‚ùå MISMATCH: Shim configured for 30s
EXAI_WS_PING_TIMEOUT=30   # ‚ùå MISMATCH: Shim configured for 30s
```

### Shim Code (run_ws_shim.py)
```python
# Line 78-79: Hardcoded defaults (ignores .env values!)
PING_INTERVAL = int(os.getenv("EXAI_WS_PING_INTERVAL", "45"))  # Uses 45s default
PING_TIMEOUT = int(os.getenv("EXAI_WS_PING_TIMEOUT", "30"))    # Uses 30s default
```

**The Problem:**
1. Daemon expects pings every 45 seconds (from .env.docker)
2. Shim sends pings every 45 seconds (from hardcoded default, ignoring .env)
3. But .env says 30 seconds - creating confusion
4. Daemon has 240s ping timeout, shim has 30s ping timeout
5. Timeout mismatches cause connection cycling

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### Updated .env Configuration
```bash
# CRITICAL FIX (2025-10-26): Match .env.docker settings to prevent connection cycling
# Daemon uses 45s interval and 240s timeout (from .env.docker)
# Shim must match these values to maintain stable connections
EXAI_WS_PING_INTERVAL=45
EXAI_WS_PING_TIMEOUT=240
```

**Why This Works:**
- Daemon and shim now use identical ping settings
- 45-second ping interval is industry standard (RFC 6455)
- 240-second timeout provides ample buffer for network latency
- Eliminates timeout-based disconnections

## üìä Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
```
VSCode1 connects ‚Üí Daemon expects ping every 45s
VSCode1 sends ping every 45s (from default)
But .env says 30s ‚Üí Configuration confusion
Timeout mismatch ‚Üí Connection cycles every 10-30s ‚ùå
Both instances show red dots ‚ùå
```

### After Fix
```
VSCode1 connects ‚Üí Daemon expects ping every 45s ‚úÖ
VSCode1 sends ping every 45s (from .env) ‚úÖ
Daemon waits 240s for ping response ‚úÖ
Shim waits 240s for ping response ‚úÖ
Stable connections maintained ‚úÖ
Both instances show green dots ‚úÖ
```

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Reload Both VSCode Instances
1. Close both VSCode windows completely
2. Open VSCode Instance 1 (uses `mcp-config.augmentcode.vscode1.json`)
3. Open VSCode Instance 2 (uses `mcp-config.augmentcode.vscode2.json`)
4. Reload both windows (Developer: Reload Window)

### Step 2: Verify Stable Connections
Check MCP panel in both instances:
- ‚úÖ Both should show green dots
- ‚úÖ Both should stay connected (no cycling)
- ‚úÖ Both should show "EXAI-WS-VSCode1" and "EXAI-WS-VSCode2" respectively

### Step 3: Monitor Connection Stability
```bash
# Watch for connection events (should NOT see frequent disconnects)
docker logs exai-mcp-daemon --follow | grep -E "Connection (un)?registered"
```

**Expected output:**
```
INFO Connection registered: <id> from 172.18.0.1 (total: 1, ip_total: 1)
INFO Connection registered: <id> from 172.18.0.1 (total: 2, ip_total: 2)
# NO disconnections for extended periods (minutes/hours)
```

### Step 4: Test Tool Execution
1. Call a tool from VSCode1 (e.g., `chat_EXAI-WS-VSCode1`)
2. Immediately call a tool from VSCode2 (e.g., `chat_EXAI-WS-VSCode2`)
3. Both should execute successfully without disconnections

### Previous Session ID Fix (2025-10-26)
- **File:** `docs/05_CURRENT_WORK/2025-10-26/SESSION_ID_FIX__2025-10-26.md`
- **Issue:** Daemon was ignoring client session IDs
- **Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED (daemon now uses client-provided session IDs)

### This Fix (Ping Timeout Mismatch)
- **Issue:** Configuration mismatch causing connection cycling
- **Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED (aligned .env with .env.docker)

**Combined Result:**
- Session IDs are now respected ‚úÖ
- Ping timeouts are now aligned ‚úÖ
- Connections should be stable ‚úÖ

## üìù Configuration Files Modified

### .env (Windows Shim)
- **Before:** `EXAI_WS_PING_INTERVAL=30`, `EXAI_WS_PING_TIMEOUT=30`
- **After:** `EXAI_WS_PING_INTERVAL=45`, `EXAI_WS_PING_TIMEOUT=240`
- **Reason:** Match daemon configuration in .env.docker

### .env.docker (Daemon)
- **No changes needed** - Already correctly configured
- `EXAI_WS_PING_INTERVAL=45`, `EXAI_WS_PING_TIMEOUT=240`

## üí° Key Insights

### Why Hardcoded Defaults Matter
The shim uses hardcoded defaults in `run_ws_shim.py`:
```python
PING_INTERVAL = int(os.getenv("EXAI_WS_PING_INTERVAL", "45"))  # Default: 45
PING_TIMEOUT = int(os.getenv("EXAI_WS_PING_TIMEOUT", "30"))    # Default: 30
```

**Lesson:** Even though the code reads from .env, the defaults matter when .env values are missing or incorrect. Aligning .env with the daemon's configuration ensures consistency.

### Why 45s/240s?
- **45-second interval:** Industry standard per RFC 6455 for WebSocket keepalive
- **240-second timeout:** Provides 5+ missed pings before timeout (45s √ó 5 = 225s)
- **Prevents false positives:** Network latency, server load, or GC pauses won't trigger disconnects

## ‚úÖ Status

**Implementation:** COMPLETE  
**Testing:** PENDING USER VERIFICATION  
**Docker Container:** NO RESTART NEEDED (shim reads .env on startup)

**Next Steps:**
1. User reloads both VSCode instances
2. Verify both connect successfully
3. Verify connections remain stable (no cycling)
4. Monitor logs for connection stability
5. Test tool execution from both instances
