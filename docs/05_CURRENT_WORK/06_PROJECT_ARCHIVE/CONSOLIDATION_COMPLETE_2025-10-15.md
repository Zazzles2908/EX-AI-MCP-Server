**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Result:** 18 files → 4 active files (3-track system)

## 🎯 What Was Done

### Before Consolidation
**18 scattered documents** across multiple topics:
- 8 auto-reconnection docs (investigation, fixes, testing)
- 1 Supabase integration plan
- 1 work summary
- 1 critical architecture fixes
- 7 other miscellaneous docs

**Problems:**
- Information overload
- Duplicate content

- Mix of completed work and active plans

### After Consolidation
**4 active documents** aligned with 3-track system:
1. `README.md` - Master index (quick reference)
2. `TRACK_1_STABILIZE_STATUS.md` - Track 1 complete
3. `TRACK_2_SCALE_PLAN.md` - Track 2 ready to start
4. `TRACK_3_STORE_PLAN.md` - Track 3 ready to start

**Benefits:**
- Clear focus (one track per day)
- Actionable plans (no fluff)
- Completed work archived
- Easy to find next steps
