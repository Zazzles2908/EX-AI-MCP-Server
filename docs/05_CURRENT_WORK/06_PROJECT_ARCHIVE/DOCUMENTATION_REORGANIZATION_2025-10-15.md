# Documentation Reorganization Report
**Date:** 2025-10-15 12:45 AEDT (00:45 UTC)  
**Phase:** 17 - Documentation Structure Cleanup  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully reorganized `docs/05_CURRENT_WORK/` folder to align with current priorities (Phases 17-19: EXAI tool testing). Moved 19 completed documents to appropriate archives, keeping only 3 active files in CURRENT_WORK.

---

## Planning Process

Used **EXAI planner tool** to create reorganization plan:
- Step 1: Analyzed current folder structure (22 files)
- Step 2: Categorized files by status and purpose
- Step 3: Created execution plan with 4 phases

**Tool Used:** `planner_EXAI-WS` with GLM-4.5-flash model  
**Result:** Clear, actionable 4-phase plan

## Changes Made

### Before Reorganization
- **Files in CURRENT_WORK:** 22
- **Status:** Mixed completed and active work
- **Organization:** Unclear priorities

### After Reorganization
- **Files in CURRENT_WORK:** 3 (active only)

## Next Steps

**Phase 18:** Test remaining EXAI tools through Augment UI
- Guide user through testing workflow tools
- Document results for each tool
- Track testing progress

**Phase 19:** Create automated test script
- Create `scripts/test_all_exai_tools.py`
- Test all 29 tools systematically
- Generate comprehensive test report

---

## Tools Used

### EXAI Tools Demonstrated
1. ✅ **planner** - Created 3-step reorganization plan
   - Model: glm-4.5-flash
   - Duration: Instant (0.0s per step)
   - Result: Clear, actionable plan

2. ✅ **PowerShell** - Executed file operations
   - Created 3 archive directories
   - Moved 19 files to appropriate locations
   - Verified all operations successful

---

## Conclusion

Successfully reorganized documentation structure to align with current priorities. The `docs/05_CURRENT_WORK/` folder now contains only 3 active files, with all completed work properly archived and organized. Clear organization principles established for future maintenance.

**Status:** ✅ **Phase 17 COMPLETE**  
**Ready for:** Phase 18 (Tool Testing) and Phase 19 (Automated Test Script)
