## üîç **ISSUES INVESTIGATED**

### **Issue 1: Debug Output Pollution** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Original Problem:**
- 7MB file content visible in debug logs during uploads
- Terminal output polluted, making debugging impossible
- EXAI would see raw file content in logs

**Investigation Findings:**
- Root cause: `OPENAI_DEBUG_LOGGING` environment variable
- Location: `src/providers/openai_compatible.py` lines 31-34
- Current status: `OPENAI_DEBUG_LOGGING=false` in `.env.docker`

**Verification:**
- Uploaded 7MB test file via both Kimi and GLM gateways
- Only metadata appeared in logs (file IDs, size, method)
- No file content pollution detected
- Clean, readable terminal output maintained

**Conclusion:** Issue was already fixed on 2025-10-24. No action needed.

### **Issue 2: Database Schema - upload_method Column** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Original Problem:**
- Missing `upload_method` column in `provider_file_uploads` table
- Error: `Could not find the 'upload_method' column`
- Database tracking failures

**Investigation Findings:**
- Queried database schema via Supabase MCP
- Column EXISTS in database (TEXT type, nullable)
- 14 total columns in provider_file_uploads table

**Verification:**
- Direct SQL query confirmed both upload records exist
- Kimi upload: `upload_method = "supabase_gateway"`
- GLM upload: `upload_method = "supabase_gateway_presigned"`
- Both records properly tracked with all metadata

**Conclusion:** Column was added via migration. Issue resolved.

## üìã **VERIFICATION TEST RESULTS**

### **Test Environment**
- Python 3.13.9
- Working Directory: C:\Project\EX-AI-MCP-Server
- Environment: .env.docker (all API keys present)

### **Test Files**
| File | Size | Method |
|------|------|--------|
| test_small.txt | 4.1 KB | embedding |
| test_medium.txt | 2.2 MB | direct_upload |
| test_large.txt | 7.0 MB | supabase_gateway_glm |

### **Test Results**
```
Phase 1: Size Validator - [PASS]
Phase 2: Kimi Gateway - [PASS]
Phase 3: GLM Gateway - [PASS]

TOTAL: 3/3 tests passed (100% success rate)
Exit Code: 0
```

### **Database Verification**
```sql
SELECT provider, provider_file_id, upload_method, filename, file_size_bytes
FROM provider_file_uploads 
WHERE supabase_file_id IN (
    '29070feb-1e7d-49b0-ac34-58b6f98a52f0',
    '8fbfce19-7baf-4c9d-8c3e-e06c88870913'
);
```

**Results:**
- 2 records found
- Both have upload_method populated
- Kimi: `supabase_gateway`
- GLM: `supabase_gateway_presigned`
