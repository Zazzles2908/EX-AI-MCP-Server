## 📊 Architecture Summary

### **Adapter Pattern Implementation:**
```
MonitoringAdapter (Abstract)
├── WebSocketAdapter (Current system)
├── RealtimeAdapter (New system)
└── DualMonitoringAdapter (Parallel operation)
```

### **Data Flow:**
```
Monitoring Events
    ↓
UnifiedMonitoringEvent (Normalized)
    ↓
Adapter Layer (WebSocket/Realtime/Dual)
    ↓
Dashboard Clients
```

### **Key Features:**
- ✅ Strategy pattern for adapter selection
- ✅ Unified data model for consistency
- ✅ Dual adapter for parallel operation
- ✅ Metrics tracking for both adapters
- ✅ Health check methods
- ✅ Graceful error handling

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Week 1 Days 3-5)

### **Day 3-4: Adapter Integration**
- [ ] Update `src/daemon/monitoring_endpoint.py` to use adapter factory
- [ ] Replace direct WebSocket broadcasting with adapter calls
- [ ] Add adapter selection logic based on environment variables
- [ ] Test backward compatibility with existing dashboard

### **Day 5: Data Validation Framework**
- [ ] Create `src/monitoring/validators/consistency_validator.py`
- [ ] Implement comparison logic for WebSocket vs Realtime outputs
- [ ] Add validation metrics and logging
- [ ] Create validation reports

---

## 📈 Metrics & Monitoring

### **Adapter Metrics Tracked:**
- Total connections
- Active connections
- Total events broadcast
- Failed broadcasts
- Supabase errors (Realtime only)

### **Validation Metrics:**
- Data consistency percentage
- Discrepancy types
- Latency differences
- Event ordering issues

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Mitigations

### **Issue 1: Realtime Adapter Connectivity**
- **Status:** Not yet tested (awaiting integration)
- **Mitigation:** Circuit breaker + fallback to WebSocket
- **Timeline:** Test during Day 3-4 integration

### **Issue 2: Data Consistency**
- **Status:** Unknown (awaiting validation framework)
- **Mitigation:** Validation framework to identify discrepancies
- **Timeline:** Implement Day 5

### **Issue 3: Performance Impact**
- **Status:** Unknown (awaiting performance testing)
- **Mitigation:** Adaptive batching (Week 2)
- **Timeline:** Implement Day 10
