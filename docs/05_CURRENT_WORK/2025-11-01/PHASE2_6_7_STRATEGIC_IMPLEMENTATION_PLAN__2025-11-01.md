# Phase 2.6 & 2.7 Strategic Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Status**: 📋 PLANNING  
**EXAI Consultation**: ac40c717-09db-4b0a-b943-6e38730a1300  
**Strategy**: Gradual Rollout with Circuit Breakers  

---

## 🎯 STRATEGIC OVERVIEW

### Why This Approach is Optimal

**EXAI Recommendation**: Gradual rollout with circuit breakers rather than big-bang migration.

**Reasoning**:
1. **Risk Mitigation**: Limits blast radius of any issues to small user segments
2. **Data Integrity**: Dual-write pattern ensures no data loss during transition
3. **Performance Validation**: Real-world performance data guides optimization
4. **User Experience**: Transparent rollout maintains trust and adoption
5. **Rollback Capability**: Instant feature flag switching enables quick recovery

## 📊 PHASE 2.6: Full Migration Strategy

### Scope: Event Classification & Phased Migration

**Event Categories**:
```
CRITICAL (Migrate First)
├── System health events
├── Error events
├── Performance alerts
└── Connection status

INFORMATIONAL (Migrate Second)
├── Debug logs
├── Verbose metrics
├── Session events
└── User actions

LEGACY (Archive/Deprecate)
├── Deprecated features
├── Old format events
└── Unused metrics
```

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 2.6.1: Event Classification System** (Week 1)
- Create event classifier in `src/monitoring/event_classifier.py`
- Implement routing logic based on event type and feature flags
- Add metrics tracking for classification accuracy

**Phase 2.6.2: Dual-Write Pattern** (Week 1-2)
- Implement dual-write to both WebSocket and Supabase
- Add sequence numbers for reconciliation
- Implement checksum validation for critical data

**Phase 2.6.3: Data Validation Pipeline** (Week 2-3)
- Create validation system in `src/monitoring/data_validator.py`
- Compare WebSocket vs Supabase event streams
- Implement automated alerts for discrepancies

**Phase 2.6.4: Canary Deployment** (Week 3-4)
- Start with 10% of events to Supabase
- Monitor error rates and latency
- Gradually increase percentage (10% → 50% → 100%)

### Feature Flags for Phase 2.6

```python
MONITORING_CRITICAL_EVENTS_SUPABASE = False  # Week 1
MONITORING_SUPABASE_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE = 0   # 0-100%
MONITORING_DUAL_WRITE_ENABLED = True         # During transition
MONITORING_DATA_VALIDATION_ENABLED = True    # Continuous
```

### Success Criteria

- ✅ All critical events flowing through Supabase
- ✅ Event delivery success rate > 99.9%
- ✅ Zero data loss during transition
- ✅ Latency < 500ms for 95th percentile
- ✅ Automated rollback triggers configured

## 🎨 PHASE 2.7: Dashboard Integration Strategy

### Scope: Progressive Component Migration

**Component Migration Order**:
```
Phase 1: Read-Only Components (Week 3)
├── Charts (events, response time, throughput, errors)
├── Metrics displays (session, cache, health)
└── Status indicators

Phase 2: Interactive Components (Week 4)
├── Filters and search
├── Time range selectors
└── Data refresh controls

Phase 3: Admin/Management (Week 5)
├── Configuration panels
├── Feature flag controls
└── System administration
```

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 2.7.1: Dashboard HTML Update** (Week 3)
- Add Supabase library script
- Add new JavaScript module imports
- Add data source indicators
- Add feature flag controls

**Phase 2.7.2: Component Integration** (Week 3-4)
- Integrate supabase-client.js
- Integrate realtime-adapter.js
- Integrate feature-flag-client.js
- Integrate cross-session-state.js

**Phase 2.7.3: Adapter-Agnostic Dashboard** (Week 4)
- Implement factory pattern for adapter selection
- Create unified dashboard controller
- Maintain consistent UI regardless of backend

**Phase 2.7.4: Testing & Validation** (Week 5)
- End-to-end tests for both modes
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Performance benchmarks
- User acceptance testing

### Feature Flags for Phase 2.7

```python
MONITORING_DASHBOARD_SUPABASE_ENABLED = False
MONITORING_DASHBOARD_DUAL_MODE = False
MONITORING_DASHBOARD_REALTIME_UPDATES = False
MONITORING_DASHBOARD_FALLBACK_MODE = True
```

### Success Criteria

- ✅ Dashboard functional in both WebSocket and Realtime modes
- ✅ Load time < 2 seconds
- ✅ Uptime > 99.9%
- ✅ Error rate < 0.1%
- ✅ User adoption > 95% within 2 weeks

## 🔄 ROLLBACK STRATEGY

### Automated Rollback Triggers

```python
ROLLBACK_TRIGGERS = {
    'error_rate': {
        'threshold': 0.05,  # 5%
        'duration': 300,    # 5 minutes
    },
    'latency': {
        'threshold': 2.0,   # 2x baseline
        'duration': 600,    # 10 minutes
    },
    'connection_failures': {
        'threshold': 3,     # consecutive
        'duration': 60,     # 1 minute
    }
}
```

### Manual Rollback Process

1. **Instant Switch**: Feature flag to WebSocket
2. **Data Reconciliation**: Sync any missed events
3. **User Notification**: Transparent communication
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate and fix
