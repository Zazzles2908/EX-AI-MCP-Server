## 🚨 **Unexpected Items Discovered**

### **Issue #1: Monitoring Server Not Running**
**Symptom:** Dashboard loads but shows "Connecting..." status  
**Root Cause:** Monitoring server (port 8080) not currently running  
**Impact:** Cannot test real-time metrics broadcasting  
**Resolution:** Need to start monitoring server to test end-to-end functionality  

### **Issue #2: Redis Connection Failures (Expected)**
**Symptom:** `[CONNECTION_MONITOR] Failed to initialize Redis persistence: Error 11001 connecting to redis:6379`  
**Root Cause:** Redis not running (expected in development environment)  
**Impact:** New implementation (L1+L2) cannot persist to Redis, falls back to L1-only  
**Resolution:** This is expected behavior - new implementation gracefully degrades to L1-only when Redis unavailable  

### **Issue #3: EXAI Tool Issues Documented**
**Added to:** `docs/05_CURRENT_WORK/2025-10-31/EXAI_TOOL_ISSUES_AND_WORKAROUNDS.md`

**Issue #4: smart_file_query Path Validation Too Restrictive**
- **Symptom:** Blocks files outside `/mnt/project/(EX-AI-MCP-Server|Personal_AI_Agent)/`
- **Example:** `/mnt/project/TensorRT_AI/streamlit_ui/components/supabase_client.py` rejected
- **Workaround:** Copy files into allowed directories or use chat tool with files parameter
- **Recommended Fix:** Add configurable path whitelist in .env

**Issue #5: GLM Rate Limiting (429 Error)**
- **Symptom:** `Error code: 429, with error text {"error":{"code":"1302","message":"High concurrency usage of this API"}}`
- **Root Cause:** GLM API rate limits exceeded during high concurrency
- **Workaround:** Reduce concurrency, add retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Recommended Fix:** Implement request queuing and rate limiting in EXAI manager

**Issue #6: Debug Tool Failure**
- **Symptom:** Debug tool had an unspecified issue
- **Status:** Needs further investigation
- **Workaround:** Use chat tool or thinkdeep tool as alternative

## 📋 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate (Week 1 Remaining):**
1. **Start Monitoring Server** - Test real-time metrics broadcasting
2. **Configure AI Auditor** - Set up automated cache monitoring rules
3. **End-to-End Testing** - Validate full workflow with both implementations

### **Week 2-3 (Monitoring Phase):**
1. Monitor cache performance with legacy implementation
2. Collect baseline metrics (hit rate, latency, error rate)
3. AI Auditor observes and reports anomalies

### **Week 4-5 (Gradual Migration):**
1. Enable new implementation for 10% of requests
2. Monitor comparative performance
3. Gradually increase to 50%, then 100%

### **Week 6-7 (Validation & Stabilization):**
1. Validate new implementation performance
2. Address any issues discovered
3. Prepare for legacy deprecation

### **Week 8 (Legacy Deprecation):**
1. Remove legacy implementation code
2. Update documentation
3. Final EXAI validation
