# File Upload System - Deep Investigation
**Date**: 2025-10-29  
**Status**: INVESTIGATION IN PROGRESS  
**EXAI Consultation ID**: 8ec88d7f-0ba4-4216-be92-4c0521b83eb6

---

## üîç INVESTIGATION SCOPE

### **Issues Observed**

1. **Kimi File Upload Timeout**
   - Symptom: 180-second timeout on complex analysis queries
   - Frequency: Consistent with complex requests
   - Impact: Cannot use Kimi for detailed file analysis
   - Workaround: Fall back to GLM

2. **GLM Initial Response Off-Topic**
   - Symptom: GLM multi-file chat returned analysis focused on file upload/management instead of actual pending tasks
   - Frequency: First attempt with GLM
   - Impact: Requires refinement with continuation ID
   - Root Cause: Unknown (possibly prompt engineering issue)

3. **Path Validation Issues**
   - Symptom: Files must be in `/mnt/project/` paths
   - Frequency: Always
   - Impact: Cannot upload files from arbitrary locations
   - Limitation: By design (security)

4. **Provider Capability Mismatch**
   - Symptom: GLM cannot handle pre-uploaded files (must re-upload each query)
   - Frequency: Always
   - Impact: Inefficient for multi-turn analysis
   - Root Cause: GLM API limitation

## üìä CURRENT ARCHITECTURE

### **Upload Tools**

1. **kimi_upload_files** (tools/providers/kimi/kimi_files.py)
   - Uploads to Kimi platform
   - Returns file IDs
   - Supports up to 100MB
   - Multiple files supported

2. **glm_upload_file** (tools/providers/glm/glm_files.py)
   - Uploads to GLM platform
   - Returns file ID
   - Supports up to 20MB
   - Single file only

3. **smart_file_query** (tools/smart_file_query.py)
   - Unified interface
   - Auto-selects provider
   - Deduplication support
   - Fallback mechanism

### **Analysis Tools**

1. **kimi_chat_with_files**
   - Analyzes uploaded files
   - Requires file_ids from kimi_upload_files
   - Supports multiple files

2. **glm_multi_file_chat**
   - Analyzes files with GLM
   - Takes file paths directly (re-uploads each time)
   - No persistent file storage

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS NEEDED

### **Question 1: Why does Kimi timeout on complex analysis?**

**Hypothesis A**: Query complexity
- Complex analysis requests exceed Kimi's processing time
- 180-second timeout is hard limit
- Solution: Simplify queries or increase timeout

**Hypothesis B**: File size interaction
- Large files + complex queries = timeout
- Solution: Chunk files or simplify analysis

**Hypothesis C**: API rate limiting
- Kimi rate limiting kicks in
- Solution: Implement backoff/retry

**Hypothesis D**: Network/infrastructure issue
- Timeout is infrastructure-level
- Solution: Implement connection pooling

### **Question 2: Why is GLM response off-topic?**

**Hypothesis A**: Prompt engineering
- System prompt not clear enough
- Solution: Improve prompt clarity

**Hypothesis B**: Model confusion
- GLM misunderstood the task
- Solution: Add explicit instructions

**Hypothesis C**: File content issue
- File content confused the model
- Solution: Add context/framing

### **Question 3: Can we improve provider selection?**

**Current Logic**:
- ALWAYS use Kimi for files (GLM cannot handle pre-uploaded files)
- GLM only for non-file operations

**Improvement Opportunities**:
- Detect when Kimi will timeout and use GLM instead
- Implement adaptive provider selection
- Add provider-specific optimizations
