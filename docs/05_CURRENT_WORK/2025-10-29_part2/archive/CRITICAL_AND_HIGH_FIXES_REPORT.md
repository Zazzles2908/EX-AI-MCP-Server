## Executive Summary

All **4 critical and high-priority bugs** identified in the File Download System have been successfully fixed and validated through comprehensive testing. The implementation is **production-ready** with proper security hardening, memory efficiency, and concurrency protection.

### Vulnerabilities Fixed
- ✅ **CRITICAL #1**: Race condition in concurrent downloads
- ✅ **CRITICAL #2**: Path traversal vulnerability  
- ✅ **HIGH #3**: Memory exhaustion with large files
- ✅ **HIGH #4**: Filename validation missing

## Technical Implementation Details

### CRITICAL FIX #1: Race Condition in Concurrent Downloads

**Problem**: Multiple concurrent downloads of the same file could trigger multiple simultaneous downloads instead of waiting for the first to complete.

**Root Cause**: Lock was released before the while loop, allowing race conditions.

**Solution**: Changed from `Set[str]` to `Dict[str, asyncio.Event]` pattern:
```python
_active_downloads: Dict[str, asyncio.Event] = {}
_download_lock = asyncio.Lock()

# Each file_id gets its own Event for proper synchronization
async with _download_lock:
    if file_id in _active_downloads:
        download_event = _active_downloads[file_id]
    else:
        download_event = asyncio.Event()
        _active_downloads[file_id] = download_event
```

**Test Coverage**: 
- ✅ Concurrent downloads of same file are serialized
- ✅ Concurrent downloads of different files proceed in parallel

---

### CRITICAL FIX #2: Path Traversal Vulnerability

**Problem**: Filename from Kimi API used directly in `os.path.join()` without validation, allowing attacks like `../../../etc/passwd`.

**Solution**: Created `_sanitize_filename()` function with multi-layer protection:
1. Regex removes dangerous characters: `< > : " / \ | ? * ` $ ( ) ; & ' space`
2. `os.path.basename()` prevents remaining traversal attempts
3. Leading dots removed to prevent hidden file access
4. Length limited to 255 characters (filesystem limit)

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Removes path separators
- ✅ Removes dangerous characters
- ✅ Handles empty input
- ✅ Limits filename length
- ✅ Handles null bytes and non-string input
- ✅ Preserves valid filenames
- ✅ Integration test with malicious filenames

---

### HIGH FIX #3: Memory Exhaustion with Large Files

**Problem**: `client.files.content()` loaded entire file into memory, causing OOM on large files.

**Solution**: Changed to streaming with `iter_content(chunk_size=8192)`:
```python
with open(temp_path, 'wb') as f:
    for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):
        if chunk:
            f.write(chunk)
```

**Benefits**:
- Constant memory usage regardless of file size
- Efficient disk I/O with 8KB chunks
- Progress logging for large files

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Streaming download uses chunks
- ✅ Large file download is memory efficient

---

### HIGH FIX #4: Filename Validation

**Problem**: No validation of filename from API before using in filesystem operations.

**Solution**: Integrated comprehensive validation into `_sanitize_filename()`:
- Type checking (must be string)
- Empty string handling
- Dangerous character removal
- Length validation
- Unicode support

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Handles reserved names
- ✅ Handles unicode filenames
- ✅ Handles dot-only filenames
