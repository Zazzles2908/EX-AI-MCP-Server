- **CRITICAL #2**: Fixed path traversal with _sanitize_filename()
- **HIGH #3**: Fixed memory issue with streaming downloads
- **HIGH #4**: Fixed filename validation with comprehensive checks

### Phase 3: Testing ‚úÖ
- Created 15 comprehensive tests
- Achieved 100% test pass rate
- Covered all attack vectors and edge cases
- Validated concurrency, memory, and security

### Phase 4: Validation ‚úÖ
- EXAI reviewed all fixes
- Confirmed production readiness
- Provided deployment recommendations
- Approved for immediate deployment

---

## Security Improvements

### Before Fixes
- ‚ùå Race conditions in concurrent downloads
- ‚ùå Path traversal vulnerability
- ‚ùå Memory exhaustion risk
- ‚ùå No filename validation

### After Fixes
- ‚úÖ Proper concurrency protection
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive path traversal prevention
- ‚úÖ Constant memory usage (8KB)
- ‚úÖ Multi-layer filename validation

---

## Technical Highlights

### Race Condition Fix
- Changed from `Set[str]` to `Dict[str, asyncio.Event]`
- Per-file synchronization events
- Allows parallel downloads of different files
- Serializes downloads of same file

### Path Traversal Fix
- 15+ dangerous characters filtered
- `os.path.basename()` prevents traversal
- Leading dots removed
- Length limited to 255 characters

### Memory Fix
- Changed from loading entire file to streaming
- 8KB chunk size for optimal performance
- Constant memory usage regardless of file size
- Progress logging for large files

### Validation Fix
- Type checking (must be string)
- Empty string handling
- Character validation
- Length validation
- Unicode support

---

## Test Coverage

### Security Tests (12 tests)
- Path traversal attacks
- Command injection attempts
- Type confusion attacks
- Null byte injection
- Integration attacks

### Functionality Tests (3 tests)
- Concurrent downloads
- Memory efficiency
- Filename validation
