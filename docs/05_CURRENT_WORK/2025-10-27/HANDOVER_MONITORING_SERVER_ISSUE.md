# Handover: Monitoring Server Not Starting
**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Status:** üî¥ BLOCKED - Monitoring server not starting after container rebuild

---

## üéØ Current Situation

Successfully fixed the WebSocket keepalive issue (added ping/pong handling) but discovered the monitoring server is not starting at all after the container rebuild.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### 1. WebSocket Keepalive Fix
**File:** `src/daemon/monitoring_endpoint.py` (lines 481-488)

Added ping/pong handling to event ingestion handler:
```python
elif msg.type == web.WSMsgType.PING:
    # Respond to ping with pong to maintain keepalive
    await ws.pong()
    logger.debug(f"[EVENT_INGESTION] Responded to ping from {request.remote}")

elif msg.type == web.WSMsgType.CLOSE:
    logger.info(f"[EVENT_INGESTION] WebSocket closed by client")
    break
```

**EXAI Validation:** Confirmed this is the correct fix for keepalive timeout issues

### 2. Docker Container Rebuild
- Successfully rebuilt container with ping/pong fix
- Container restarted successfully
- Environment variables confirmed correct

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUE: Monitoring Server Not Starting

### Problem
The monitoring server (port 8080) is NOT starting, even though:
- ‚úÖ `MONITORING_ENABLED=true` in environment
- ‚úÖ `MONITORING_PORT=8080` configured
- ‚úÖ `MONITORING_HOST=0.0.0.0` configured
- ‚ùå No monitoring server logs in Docker output
- ‚ùå Only WebSocket daemon (port 8079) is starting

### Evidence
**Docker logs show:**
```
2025-10-27 23:27:25 INFO ws_daemon: Starting WS daemon on ws://0.0.0.0:8079
2025-10-27 23:27:25 INFO ws_daemon: ‚úÖ WebSocket server successfully started and listening on ws://0.0.0.0:8079
```

**Missing logs (should be present):**
```
INFO src.daemon.monitoring_endpoint: [MONITORING] Registered /events endpoint for test event ingestion
INFO src.daemon.monitoring_endpoint: [MONITORING] Monitoring server running on ws://0.0.0.0:8080
```

### Root Cause (Hypothesis)
The monitoring server initialization code may not be executing. Possible causes:
1. Monitoring server startup code not being called in `ws_daemon.py`
2. Silent failure during monitoring server initialization
3. Code path changed during recent refactoring

---

## üìã Investigation Steps Needed

### Step 1: Check Monitoring Server Startup Code
**File:** `ws_daemon.py`

Look for:
- Where monitoring server is initialized
- Check if `MONITORING_ENABLED` is being read correctly
- Verify monitoring server startup is not wrapped in a condition that's failing

### Step 2: Check for Silent Failures
- Add debug logging to monitoring server initialization
- Check if there's a try/except block swallowing errors
- Verify all imports are successful

### Step 3: Test Monitoring Server Independently
- Try starting monitoring server manually inside container
- Verify `src/daemon/monitoring_endpoint.py` can be imported
- Check for any missing dependencies

## üîß Files Modified (This Session)

1. **`src/daemon/monitoring_endpoint.py`**
   - Lines 481-488: Added ping/pong handling
   - Lines 438-498: Event ingestion handler (complete implementation)
   - Line 860: Route registration for `/events`

2. **`scripts/testing/test_event_generator.py`**
   - Updated WebSocket URL to `ws://localhost:8080/events`

3. **`scripts/testing/test_ws_connection.py`**
   - Created for connection testing

4. **`scripts/testing/test_ws_internal.py`**
   - Created for internal container testing

---

## üìä Test Results Summary

### Internal Container Test (Before Monitoring Server Issue)
‚úÖ **SUCCESS** - Event ingestion endpoint worked perfectly
```
‚úÖ Connected to ws://localhost:8080/events
‚úÖ Sent test event
‚úÖ Received: {"status": "received", "event_type": "test"}
```

### Baseline Test (Before Monitoring Server Issue)
‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL SUCCESS** - 14 events sent before keepalive timeout
- This led to the ping/pong fix

### Current Status
‚ùå **BLOCKED** - Cannot test because monitoring server not starting

---

## üöÄ Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Priority 1)
1. **Investigate why monitoring server not starting**
   - Check `ws_daemon.py` for monitoring server initialization
   - Add debug logging to track execution path
   - Verify `MONITORING_ENABLED` is being read

2. **Fix monitoring server startup**
   - Ensure monitoring server starts alongside WebSocket daemon
   - Verify `/events` endpoint is registered
   - Confirm server listens on port 8080

3. **Test ping/pong fix**
   - Run baseline test with fixed keepalive handling
   - Verify connection stays alive beyond 14 events
   - Complete full 2-minute baseline test

### Short-term (Priority 2)
4. **Complete Phase 1 Baseline Testing**
   - Run full 30-minute baseline test
   - Verify 0 API calls to GLM/Kimi
   - Collect baseline metrics
   - Get EXAI validation

5. **Phase 2: Controlled Activation**
   - Enable AI Auditor with conservative settings
   - Run 1-hour test with 30 calls/hour limit
   - Monitor API call count
   - Verify rate limiting works

### Long-term (Priority 3)
6. **Monitoring Dashboard Integration**
   - Verify test events appear in dashboard
   - Use Playwright for visual validation
   - Document end-to-end system behavior

7. **Phase 3: Full Feature Validation**
   - Test with production settings (60 calls/hour)
   - Run 2-3 hour comprehensive test
   - Final EXAI validation

## üîç EXAI Consultation Summary

### Consultation 1: Event Ingestion Architecture
**Result:** ‚úÖ Created `/events` endpoint separate from dashboard `/ws`

### Consultation 2: Function Name Error
**Result:** ‚úÖ Fixed `broadcast_to_dashboards()` ‚Üí `broadcast_monitoring_event()`

### Consultation 3: Docker Networking Issue
**Result:** ‚úÖ Run tests from inside container using `docker exec`

### Consultation 4: WebSocket Keepalive Timeout
**Result:** ‚úÖ Added ping/pong handling to event ingestion handler

**Continuation ID:** `a864f2ff-462f-42f4-bef7-d40e4bddb314` (14 exchanges remaining)

---

## üìÅ Key Files for Investigation

1. **`ws_daemon.py`** - Main daemon startup, should initialize monitoring server
2. **`src/daemon/monitoring_endpoint.py`** - Monitoring server implementation
3. **`.env.docker`** - Environment configuration (MONITORING_ENABLED=true)
4. **`docker-compose.yml`** - Port mapping (8080:8080)

---

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **WebSocket Keepalive:** Must handle PING messages and respond with pong()
2. **Docker Networking:** Windows Docker Desktop has WebSocket upgrade issues
3. **Container Testing:** Run tests from inside container for reliability
4. **Silent Failures:** Always verify services actually start, not just that config is correct

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Notes

- **Token Budget:** 59K remaining (started at 200K)
- **EXAI Exchanges:** 14 remaining on continuation ID
- **Blocking Issue:** Cannot proceed with testing until monitoring server starts
- **User Request:** Fix issue with EXAI help, then proceed to Phase 2

---

**Next Action:** Investigate `ws_daemon.py` to find why monitoring server not starting
