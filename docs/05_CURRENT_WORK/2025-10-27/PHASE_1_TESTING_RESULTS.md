# Phase 1 Testing Results - AI Auditor System
**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Status:** ‚úÖ PARTIAL SUCCESS - Event Ingestion Working, Keepalive Issue Identified

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

Successfully implemented and tested the event ingestion endpoint for AI Auditor testing. The WebSocket endpoint works correctly and can receive/process test events. Identified a Docker networking limitation on Windows and a WebSocket keepalive timeout issue that needs resolution.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Event Ingestion Endpoint Implementation
- **File:** `src/daemon/monitoring_endpoint.py`
- **Changes:**
  - Added `event_ingestion_handler()` function (lines 438-489)
  - Registered `/events` route (line 860)
  - Fixed function name from `broadcast_to_dashboards()` to `broadcast_monitoring_event()`
  - Added startup logging for endpoint registration

### 2. Test Event Generator
- **File:** `scripts/testing/test_event_generator.py`
- **Changes:**
  - Updated default WebSocket URL from `ws://localhost:8080/ws` to `ws://localhost:8080/events`
  - Configured to generate realistic test events (health_check, api_request, error)

### 3. Docker Container Updates
- Rebuilt container with new event ingestion endpoint
- Verified endpoint registration in logs
- Confirmed monitoring server running on port 8080

## üß™ Test Results

### Internal Container Test (‚úÖ SUCCESS)
**Command:** `docker exec exai-mcp-daemon python3 /app/test_ws.py`

**Results:**
```
‚úÖ Connected to ws://localhost:8080/events
‚úÖ Sent test event
‚úÖ Received: {"status": "received", "event_type": "test"}
‚úÖ Test successful!
```

**Conclusion:** Event ingestion endpoint works perfectly from inside the container.

### Baseline Test (‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL SUCCESS)
**Command:** `docker exec exai-mcp-daemon python3 /app/test_event_generator.py --mode baseline --duration 2 --rate 20`

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ Connected successfully to WebSocket endpoint
- ‚úÖ Sent 14 events successfully
- ‚ùå Encountered keepalive ping timeouts after ~14 events
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only achieved 6.90 events/minute (target: 20 events/minute)

**Events Sent:**
- health_check events (severity: info)
- api_request events (severity: warning/info)
- error events (severity: error)

**Error Pattern:**
```
Error sending event: sent 1011 (internal error) keepalive ping timeout; no close frame received
```

## üîç Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Docker Networking on Windows
**Problem:** WebSocket connections from Windows host to Docker container timeout  
**Root Cause:** Docker Desktop on Windows NAT layer interferes with WebSocket upgrade handshake  
**Evidence:**
- HTTP connections to port 8080 work (monitoring dashboard accessible)
- WebSocket connections from host timeout
- WebSocket connections from inside container work perfectly

**Solution:** Run tests from inside the container using `docker exec`

**EXAI Validation:** Confirmed this is a known Docker Desktop on Windows limitation, not a code issue

### Issue 2: WebSocket Keepalive Timeout
**Problem:** WebSocket connection drops after ~14 events with keepalive ping timeout  
**Root Cause:** TBD - needs investigation  
**Potential Causes:**
1. Event ingestion handler not responding to ping frames
2. WebSocket timeout configuration too aggressive
3. Event processing blocking the WebSocket event loop

**Next Steps:**
1. Add ping/pong handling to event ingestion handler
2. Increase WebSocket timeout configuration
3. Ensure event processing is non-blocking

## üìä Metrics & Performance

### Baseline Test Metrics
- **Total Events Sent:** 14
- **Duration:** 2.03 minutes
- **Actual Rate:** 6.90 events/minute
- **Target Rate:** 20 events/minute
- **Success Rate:** 100% for first 14 events, then connection dropped

### Event Distribution
- health_check: ~30%
- api_request: ~50%
- error: ~20%

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Event Ingestion Handler
<augment_code_snippet path="src/daemon/monitoring_endpoint.py" mode="EXCERPT">
```python
async def event_ingestion_handler(request: web.Request) -> web.WebSocketResponse:
    """Handle event ingestion from test generators (2025-10-27)."""
    ws = web.WebSocketResponse()
    await ws.prepare(request)
    
    logger.info(f"[EVENT_INGESTION] Test generator connected from {request.remote}")
    
    try:
        async for msg in ws:
            if msg.type == web.WSMsgType.TEXT:
                try:
                    event_data = json.loads(msg.data)
                    
                    # Broadcast event to all connected dashboard clients
                    await broadcast_monitoring_event({
                        "type": "test_event",
                        "event": event_data,
                        "timestamp": log_timestamp()
                    })
                    
                    # Send acknowledgment
                    await ws.send_str(json.dumps({"status": "received", "event_type": event_data.get("type")}))
```
</augment_code_snippet>

### Route Registration
<augment_code_snippet path="src/daemon/monitoring_endpoint.py" mode="EXCERPT">
```python
# Event ingestion endpoint for testing (2025-10-27)
app.router.add_get('/events', event_ingestion_handler)
logger.info("[MONITORING] Registered /events endpoint for test event ingestion")
```
</augment_code_snippet>

## üìù EXAI Consultation Summary

### Consultation 1: Event Ingestion Architecture
**Issue:** Test script timing out during WebSocket handshake  
**EXAI Recommendation:** Create dedicated `/events` endpoint separate from dashboard `/ws` endpoint  
**Result:** ‚úÖ Implemented successfully

### Consultation 2: Function Name Error
**Issue:** `broadcast_to_dashboards()` function doesn't exist  
**EXAI Recommendation:** Use `broadcast_monitoring_event()` instead  
**Result:** ‚úÖ Fixed successfully

### Consultation 3: Docker Networking Issue
**Issue:** WebSocket connections from Windows host timeout  
**EXAI Analysis:** Docker Desktop on Windows NAT layer interferes with WebSocket upgrade  
**EXAI Recommendation:** Run tests from inside container using `docker exec`  
**Result:** ‚úÖ Confirmed working

**Continuation ID:** `a864f2ff-462f-42f4-bef7-d40e4bddb314` (13 exchanges remaining)

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **Docker Networking:** WebSocket connections behave differently than HTTP in Docker Desktop on Windows
2. **Testing Strategy:** Container-based testing is more reliable than host-based testing
3. **EXAI Collaboration:** Systematic consultation with EXAI helped identify and resolve issues quickly
4. **Incremental Progress:** Breaking down testing into small steps (simple connection ‚Üí event sending ‚Üí full test) helped isolate issues
