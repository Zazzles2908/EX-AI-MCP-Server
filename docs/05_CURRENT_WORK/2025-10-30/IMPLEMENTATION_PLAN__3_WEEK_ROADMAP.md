## üéØ STRATEGIC SHIFT: SUPABASE HUB ARCHITECTURE

### THE PROBLEM
Current file upload tools ONLY work for applications with Docker container access (`/mnt/project` paths). External applications (Claude Desktop, VSCode on different machines, mobile apps, web apps) **cannot** use these paths.

### THE SOLUTION: SUPABASE HUB
**Universal File Access Architecture:**
```
Application (anywhere)
  ‚Üí Upload to Supabase Storage
  ‚Üí Trigger EXAI-MCP-Server processing
  ‚Üí EXAI downloads from Supabase
  ‚Üí EXAI processes with AI
  ‚Üí EXAI uploads result to Supabase
  ‚Üí Application downloads result
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Universal access (any app, any machine, any network)
- ‚úÖ Persistence (files survive container restarts)
- ‚úÖ Deduplication (SHA256-based content addressing)
- ‚úÖ Scalability (Supabase handles CDN, caching, access control)
- ‚úÖ Already have Supabase Pro (100GB storage, unlimited bandwidth)

**Tradeoffs:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è +1.6s overhead per file operation (acceptable for universal access)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex architecture (mitigated by phased implementation)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Supabase dependency (mitigated by local cache fallback)
