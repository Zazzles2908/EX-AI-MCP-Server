## 🔧 Manual Testing Checklist

### **Test 1: Direct Mode (WebSocket Only)**
- [ ] Start server with default settings (all flags disabled)
- [ ] Connect dashboard to `ws://localhost:8080/ws`
- [ ] Verify initial stats received
- [ ] Trigger monitoring events
- [ ] Verify events appear in dashboard
- [ ] Check metrics in browser console

### **Test 2: Adapter Mode (Realtime Only)**
- [ ] Set `MONITORING_USE_ADAPTER=true`
- [ ] Set `MONITORING_ADAPTER_TYPE=realtime`
- [ ] Start server
- [ ] Connect dashboard
- [ ] Verify events broadcast via Realtime
- [ ] Check Supabase monitoring_events table for data

### **Test 3: Dual Mode (WebSocket + Realtime)**
- [ ] Set `MONITORING_DUAL_MODE=true`
- [ ] Start server
- [ ] Connect dashboard
- [ ] Trigger monitoring events
- [ ] Verify events in both WebSocket and Realtime
- [ ] Compare data consistency
- [ ] Check metrics show both paths active

### **Test 4: Adapter Failure Handling**
- [ ] Enable adapter mode
- [ ] Simulate adapter failure (mock exception)
- [ ] Verify WebSocket still works
- [ ] Check error logging
- [ ] Verify metrics track failures

### **Test 5: Client Disconnection**
- [ ] Connect multiple dashboard clients
- [ ] Disconnect one client
- [ ] Verify other clients still receive events
- [ ] Check metrics updated correctly

### **Test 6: Performance**
- [ ] Broadcast 1000 events rapidly
- [ ] Measure latency (target: <100ms)
- [ ] Check memory usage
- [ ] Verify no event loss

### **Test 7: Metrics Accuracy**
- [ ] Broadcast 10 events
- [ ] Check metrics: total_broadcasts = 10
- [ ] Check metrics: direct_broadcasts = 10
- [ ] Verify adapter_broadcasts = 0 (if adapter disabled)

## 🎯 Key Tests to Prioritize

### **Critical Path (Must Pass):**
1. ✅ Broadcaster initialization
2. ✅ Client registration/unregistration
3. ✅ Direct mode broadcasting
4. ✅ Disconnected client handling
5. ✅ Metrics tracking

### **Important (Should Pass):**
1. ✅ Batch broadcasting
2. ✅ Health checks
3. ✅ Feature flag initialization
4. ✅ Adapter creation

### **Nice to Have (Can Defer):**
1. ✅ Performance benchmarks
2. ✅ Stress testing
3. ✅ Long-running stability

## 🚀 Running Tests

### **Unit Tests:**
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/test_monitoring_broadcaster.py -v

# Run specific test class
pytest tests/test_monitoring_broadcaster.py::TestMonitoringBroadcaster -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/test_monitoring_broadcaster.py --cov=src.monitoring
```

### **Manual Testing:**
```bash
# Start server with feature flags
export MONITORING_USE_ADAPTER=false
export MONITORING_DUAL_MODE=false
python -m src.daemon.main

# In another terminal, connect to dashboard
# http://localhost:8080/monitoring_dashboard.html
```

## 📊 Expected Test Results

### **Unit Tests:**
- ✅ All 19 tests should pass
- ✅ No warnings or errors
- ✅ Code coverage >80%

### **Manual Tests:**
- ✅ Direct mode: Events appear in dashboard
- ✅ Adapter mode: Events in Supabase
- ✅ Dual mode: Events in both systems
- ✅ Failure handling: Graceful degradation
- ✅ Performance: <100ms latency
