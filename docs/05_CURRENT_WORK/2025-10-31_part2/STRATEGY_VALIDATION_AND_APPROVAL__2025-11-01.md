**Automated Rollback**:
```
Error rate > 5% for 5 minutes
    ↓
Automatic trigger
    ↓
Feature flag switched to WebSocket
    ↓
Affected users (10%) instantly recovered
    ↓
Unaffected users (90%) continue
```

**Recovery Time**: < 1 minute

**Recovery Score**: 🟢 **EXCELLENT** (10/10)

**Comparison**:
- Big-Bang: 🔴 **POOR** (hours to recover)
- Slow Rollout: 🟢 **EXCELLENT** (but unnecessary)

**Verdict**: ✅ **OPTIMAL** - Fastest recovery with minimal disruption

---

### 6. Timeline: ✅ EXCELLENT

**8-Week Timeline**:
- Week 1-2: Foundation (event classification, dual-write)
- Week 3-4: Migration (10% → 50% rollout)
- Week 5-6: Integration (dashboard components)
- Week 7-8: Full rollout (100% migration)

**Timeline Score**: 🟢 **EXCELLENT** (8/10)

**Comparison**:
- Big-Bang: 🟢 **IMMEDIATE** (but risky)
- Slow Rollout: 🔴 **VERY LONG** (6+ months)

**Verdict**: ✅ **OPTIMAL** - Reasonable timeline with safety

---

### 7. Resource Efficiency: ✅ EXCELLENT

**Resource Allocation**:
- Week 1-2: 2 engineers (foundation)
- Week 3-4: 2 engineers (migration)
- Week 5-6: 1 engineer (integration)
- Week 7-8: 1 engineer (monitoring)

**Total Effort**: ~8 engineer-weeks

**Resource Score**: 🟢 **EXCELLENT** (8/10)

**Comparison**:
- Big-Bang: 🟡 **MODERATE** (high support burden)
- Slow Rollout: 🔴 **POOR** (extended resource commitment)

**Verdict**: ✅ **OPTIMAL** - Efficient resource usage

---

### 8. Business Value: ✅ EXCELLENT

**Business Benefits**:
- ✅ Scalable monitoring system (supports 1000+ users)
- ✅ Persistent data (no loss on reconnect)
- ✅ Real-time updates (< 500ms latency)
- ✅ Multi-user support (cross-session state)
- ✅ Reduced infrastructure costs (Supabase vs custom WebSocket)

**Business Value Score**: 🟢 **EXCELLENT** (9/10)
