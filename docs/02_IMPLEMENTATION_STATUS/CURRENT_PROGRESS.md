## üìã COMPLETED MILESTONES

### ‚úÖ GLM Web Search Fix (2025-10-19)

**Problem:** Other MCP clients receiving raw `<TOOL_CALL>` JSON instead of search results
**Root Cause:** GLM-4.6 using new uppercase JSON format not recognized by text format handler
**Solution:** Added Format G pattern recognition to `src/providers/text_format_handler.py`
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed, container rebuilt and restarted
**Validation:** EXAI 5-round research confirmed fix is correct

### ‚úÖ Bottleneck Analysis (2025-10-19)

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Analyzed Docker logs from 5-round EXAI research
- ‚úÖ Identified 4 critical bottlenecks (WebSocket, Supabase, Context, Files)
- ‚úÖ Consulted EXAI for priority ranking and solutions
- ‚úÖ Discovered existing sessions table in Supabase (unused)
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive bottleneck documentation

**Key Findings:**
- **WebSocket:** 15 connection errors in 5 rounds (pattern: after long responses >87s)
- **Supabase:** 6 calls per turn (3 before, 3 after) - synchronous blocking
- **Context:** Exponential growth (9 ‚Üí 12 ‚Üí 15 ‚Üí 18 messages loaded per turn)
- **Files:** 6 files excluded every turn (loaded then discarded)

**Deliverables:**
- `docs/current/EXAI_5_ROUND_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/current/BOTTLENECK_ANALYSIS_2025-10-19.md` (to be created)

### ‚úÖ Documentation Consolidation (2025-10-19)

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Created new folder structure following EXAI recommendations
- ‚úÖ Moved context engineering docs to `docs/01_ARCHITECTURE/CONTEXT_ENGINEERING/`
- ‚úÖ Created executive summaries in `docs/03_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARIES/`
- ‚úÖ Established implementation status tracking in `docs/02_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS/`
- ‚úÖ Received comprehensive EXAI architectural consultation (2 consultations total)

**Deliverables:**
- `docs/01_ARCHITECTURE/EXAI_ARCHITECTURAL_CONSULTATION_2025-10-19.md`
- `docs/03_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARIES/CONTEXT_ENGINEERING_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/03_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARIES/ARCHITECTURE_UPGRADE_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/01_ARCHITECTURE/CONTEXT_ENGINEERING/CONTEXT_ENGINEERING_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/01_ARCHITECTURE/CONTEXT_ENGINEERING/EXAI_VALIDATION_RESPONSE.md`

## üìà METRICS

### Token Usage (Pre-Implementation)
- **Current:** 4.6M tokens per 10-turn conversation
- **Target:** 50K tokens per 10-turn conversation
- **Expected Reduction:** 99%

### Cost Savings (Expected)
- **Current:** $2.81 per conversation (GLM-4.6)
- **Target:** $0.03 per conversation
