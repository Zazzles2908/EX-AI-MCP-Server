# Language Issue Fix Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-03  
**Issue:** Chinese error messages appearing in Moonshot API responses  
**Status:** ✅ PARTIALLY FIXED

---

## 🔍 **PROBLEM ANALYSIS**

### **Two Types of Chinese Text:**

1. **Model Responses** (✅ CAN FIX)
   - Code review findings
   - Recommendations
   - Explanations
   - **Solution:** Add explicit English instruction to prompt

2. **API Error Messages** (❌ CANNOT FIX)
   - System-level errors from Moonshot servers
   - Example: "text extract error: 没有解析出内容"
   - These happen BEFORE the request reaches the model
   - **Reality:** We have to accept these in Chinese

---

## ✅ **WHAT WAS FIXED**

### **File Modified:** `scripts/kimi_code_review.py`

**Line 202:** Added explicit English instruction

```python
prompt = f"""You are a senior Python code reviewer analyzing the EX-AI-MCP-Server codebase.

**IMPORTANT:** Please respond ONLY in English. All findings, recommendations, and explanations must be in English.

**DESIGN CONTEXT:**
...
```

**Effect:**
- ✅ Model responses will be in English
- ✅ Code review findings will be in English
- ✅ Recommendations will be in English
- ❌ API error messages will still be in Chinese (system-level)

---

## 📊 **WHAT TO EXPECT**

### **English Responses:**
- All code review content
- All findings and recommendations
- All summaries and analysis

### **Chinese Error Messages (Unavoidable):**
- File upload errors: "text extract error: 没有解析出内容"
- API rate limit errors
- Authentication errors
- Other system-level errors

**Translation Reference:**
- "没有解析出内容" = "No content could be parsed"
- "请求过于频繁" = "Too many requests"
- "认证失败" = "Authentication failed"

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION**

**Accept the hybrid approach:**
1. ✅ Model responses in English (fixed with prompt)
2. ❌ API errors in Chinese (unavoidable, system-level)

**Why This Is OK:**
- API errors are rare (only when files can't be parsed)
- Error messages are logged and skipped gracefully
- The important content (code review) is in English
- We can translate error messages when needed

---

## 🔧 **ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES (NOT RECOMMENDED)**

### **Option 1: Add System Message**
```python
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are Kimi. Always respond in English."},
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
```
**Issue:** Moonshot API might override system messages with their default

### **Option 2: Post-Process Translation**
- Detect Chinese text in responses
- Translate to English using another API
**Issue:** Adds complexity, cost, and latency

### **Option 3: Contact Moonshot Support**
- Request English API error messages
**Issue:** Unlikely to change for a Chinese company's API

---

## ✅ **FINAL VERDICT**

**Current Solution:** ✅ OPTIMAL

- Model responses: English (via prompt instruction)
- API errors: Chinese (unavoidable, rare)
- Trade-off: Acceptable for production use

**No further action needed** - the fix is in place and will take effect on the next run.

**Status:** Ready for testing with next code review run
