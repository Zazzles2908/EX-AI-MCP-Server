# Kimi Script Run Results - Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-03  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CLEANUP FAILED - STILL REVIEWING CACHED FILES**  
**Issue:** Script couldn't access Kimi provider to delete old files

---

## üîç **WHAT HAPPENED**

### **Script Execution:**
```
üßπ Cleaning up old files from Kimi platform...
‚ö†Ô∏è  Kimi provider not available, skipping cleanup
```

### **Root Cause:**
The cleanup function tried to access the Kimi provider using:
```python
from src.providers.registry import ModelProviderRegistry
provider = ModelProviderRegistry.get_provider("KIMI")
```

**Problem:** The script runs in a standalone Python process (not within the MCP server context), so the provider registry is not initialized. The cleanup was skipped, and Kimi served cached files again.

---

## üìä **RESULTS**

### **Kimi's Review (STILL OLD CODE):**
Checking `docs/KIMI_RAW_BATCH_1.md`:

```markdown
### CRITICAL: Silent exception handling in history store
**File:** `src/history_store.py`
**Lines:** 56-59, 75-78
```

**This issue was ALREADY FIXED!** Our current code (lines 76-79) has:
```python
except (OSError, IOError, PermissionError) as e:
    logger.warning(f"Failed to load conversation history for {continuation_id}: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error loading conversation history for {continuation_id}: {e}")
```

**Conclusion:** Kimi is STILL reviewing cached files from the first upload.

---

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTIONS**

### **Option 1: Manual Cleanup via Kimi Web Interface (RECOMMENDED)**

1. Go to https://platform.moonshot.ai/console/files
2. Log in with your Moonshot account
3. Delete all uploaded files
4. Re-run the script: `python scripts/kimi_code_review.py --target src`

**Pros:**
- Simple and guaranteed to work
- No code changes needed
- Immediate solution

**Cons:**
- Manual step required

---

### **Option 2: Fix Cleanup to Work in Standalone Script**

Modify `scripts/kimi_code_review.py` to use direct SDK access instead of provider registry:

```python
def cleanup_kimi_files(self) -> None:
    """Delete all previously uploaded files from Kimi platform."""
    logger.info("üßπ Cleaning up old files from Kimi platform...")
    
    try:
        import os
        from openai import OpenAI
        
        # Get API key directly from environment
        api_key = os.getenv("MOONSHOT_API_KEY")
        if not api_key:
            logger.warning("‚ö†Ô∏è  MOONSHOT_API_KEY not found, skipping cleanup")
            return
        
        # Create SDK client directly
        client = OpenAI(
            api_key=api_key,
            base_url="https://api.moonshot.ai/v1"
        )
        
        # List all files
        response = client.files.list()
        files = response.data if hasattr(response, 'data') else []
        
        if not files:
            logger.info("‚úÖ No files to clean up")
            return
        
        logger.info(f"üìã Found {len(files)} file(s) to delete")
        
        # Delete each file
        deleted_count = 0
        for file in files:
            try:
                client.files.delete(file.id)
                deleted_count += 1
                logger.info(f"  ‚úì Deleted: {file.filename}")
            except Exception as e:
                logger.warning(f"  ‚úó Failed to delete {file.filename}: {e}")
        
        logger.info(f"‚úÖ Cleanup complete: {deleted_count} deleted")
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"‚ùå Cleanup failed: {e}")
        logger.warning("‚ö†Ô∏è  Continuing with review despite cleanup failure...")
```

**Pros:**
- Automated solution
- Works in standalone script
- No manual steps

**Cons:**
- Requires code modification
- Need to test

---

### **Option 3: Use Unique Filenames**

Modify the upload logic to append timestamps to filenames:

```python
import time
timestamp = int(time.time())
unique_name = f"{file.stem}_{timestamp}{file.suffix}"
```

**Pros:**
- Bypasses cache issue
- No cleanup needed

**Cons:**
- Files accumulate on platform
- Costs more (no cache reuse)
- Need to manually clean up later

---

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED ACTION**

**I recommend Option 1 (Manual Cleanup) because:**

1. ‚úÖ **Guaranteed to work** - No code changes, no testing needed
2. ‚úÖ **Immediate** - Can be done right now
3. ‚úÖ **Simple** - Just delete files via web interface
4. ‚úÖ **One-time** - After this, files will be fresh

**Steps:**
1. Visit https://platform.moonshot.ai/console/files
2. Select all files
3. Click "Delete"
4. Re-run: `python scripts/kimi_code_review.py --target src`
5. Verify Kimi sees the fixed code

## üìù **WHAT WE LEARNED**

### **Key Insights:**

1. **Kimi Platform Caching is Aggressive**
   - Files are cached by filename
   - Cache persists across uploads
   - Must explicitly delete old files

2. **Script Context Matters**
   - Standalone scripts can't access MCP server context
   - Provider registry not available outside server
   - Need direct SDK access for standalone operations

3. **Automated Cleanup Needs Direct SDK**
   - Can't rely on provider registry in scripts
   - Must use OpenAI SDK directly with API key
   - Environment variables are the source of truth

---

## ‚úÖ **NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate:**
1. **Manual cleanup** via Kimi web interface
2. **Re-run script** to get fresh review
3. **Verify** Kimi sees our fixes

### **Future Improvement:**
1. **Implement Option 2** (direct SDK cleanup)
2. **Test** in standalone script context
3. **Document** for future use
