## 🧪 Pending Validation

### Stress Testing (NEXT STEP)
- [ ] **Run Stress Test:** Execute `python scripts/stress_test_exai.py --duration 60 --concurrent 10`
- [ ] **Validate Fix #1:** Monitor semaphore cleanup on timeout
- [ ] **Validate Fix #2:** Check `_inflight_reqs` memory usage
- [ ] **Validate Fix #3/4:** Verify thread-safe initialization
- [ ] **Validate Fix #5:** Confirm provider detection/registration thread safety
- [ ] **Performance Metrics:** Collect response times, success rates, throughput
- [ ] **Error Analysis:** Review any failures or timeouts

### Test Scenarios (Recommended by EXAI)

**1. Semaphore Leak Validation**
- Run tests with intentional timeouts
- Monitor semaphore counts during high-concurrency
- Verify semaphores are released on timeout
- Check for connection pool exhaustion

**2. Memory Leak Detection**
- Run extended tests (5+ minutes)
- Monitor `_inflight_reqs` set size
- Look for unbounded memory growth
- Verify cleanup in finally blocks

**3. Thread Safety Verification**
- Test concurrent provider initialization
- Verify no duplicate detection/registration
- Check for race conditions in check-then-act patterns
- Monitor for deadlocks or blocking

**4. Timeout Handling**
- Test with various timeout values
- Verify graceful degradation
- Check error messages and logging
- Ensure proper cleanup on timeout

**5. Error Recovery**
- Test recovery after failures
- Verify system stability after errors
- Check logging and error reporting
- Validate resilience mechanisms

## 🔍 Monitoring & Observability

### Logs to Monitor
- **Semaphore Cleanup:** "Released semaphore after timeout"
- **Memory Cleanup:** "Removed {req_id} from _inflight_reqs"
- **Provider Init:** "Providers already configured" (fast path)
- **Thread Safety:** "Provider detection already complete"
- **Errors:** CRITICAL messages about semaphore/cleanup failures

### Metrics to Track
- **Semaphore Values:** Current/max semaphore counts
- **Memory Usage:** `_inflight_reqs` set size
- **Request Rates:** Requests per second
- **Response Times:** P50, P95, P99 latencies
- **Error Rates:** Failed/timeout requests
- **Concurrent Sessions:** Active session count

### Health Checks
- **Container Status:** All containers running
- **Provider Status:** Kimi and GLM available
- **Database Status:** Supabase and Redis connected
- **WebSocket Status:** Daemon accepting connections
- **Queue Status:** Conversation queue not backed up

## ⚠️ Known Risks

### Potential Issues
1. **Stress Test Failures** - May reveal additional issues
2. **Performance Degradation** - Under high load
3. **Memory Leaks** - Not caught by current fixes
4. **Race Conditions** - In untested code paths
5. **Timeout Issues** - With slow AI providers

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Testing** - Start with low load, increase gradually
2. **Monitoring** - Watch logs and metrics during tests
3. **Rollback Plan** - Keep previous version available
4. **Error Handling** - Graceful degradation on failures
5. **Circuit Breakers** - Prevent cascade failures

## 📝 Notes

### EXAI Recommendations
- Run stress test before Week 2 fixes
- Focus on scenarios that validate Week 1 fixes
- Monitor for semaphore leaks, memory growth, race conditions
- Ensure adequate logging and metrics
- Test error recovery and resilience

### Time Savings
- **Week 1 Estimated:** 22-26 hours
- **Week 1 Actual:** ~4 hours
- **Efficiency Gain:** 82-85%

### Lessons Learned
- Double-checked locking pattern is effective for thread safety
- Explicit cleanup in exception handlers prevents leaks
- Documentation accuracy is critical for preventing bugs
- Stress testing is essential before production deployment
