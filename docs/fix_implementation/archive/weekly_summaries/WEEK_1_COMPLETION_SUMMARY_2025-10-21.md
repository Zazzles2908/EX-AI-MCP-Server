## Fixes Implemented

### Fix #1: Semaphore Leak on Timeout ✅
**File:** `src/daemon/ws_server.py:797-822`  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Time:** ~1 hour

**Problem:**
- Early return on timeout bypassed finally block
- Semaphore acquired but never released
- Caused connection pool exhaustion over time

**Solution:**
```python
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    # WEEK 1 FIX #1 (2025-10-21): Release semaphore before returning on timeout
    if USE_PER_SESSION_SEMAPHORES and session_acquired and session_semaphore:
        try:
            session_semaphore.release()
            session_acquired = False
            logger.debug(f"[SESSION_SEM] Released semaphore for conversation {conversation_id} after timeout")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.critical(f"CRITICAL: Failed to release session semaphore after timeout: {e}", exc_info=True)
    elif global_acquired:
        try:
            _global_sem.release()
            global_acquired = False
            logger.debug("Released global semaphore after timeout")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.critical(f"CRITICAL: Failed to release global semaphore after timeout: {e}", exc_info=True)
    
    await _safe_send(ws, {"error": "OVER_CAPACITY"})
    return
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Prevents semaphore leaks on timeout
- ✅ Matches existing cleanup pattern (lines 844-877)
- ✅ Explicit error logging for debugging
- ✅ Resets acquisition flags to prevent double-release

---

### Fix #2: _inflight_reqs Memory Leak ✅
**File:** `src/daemon/ws_server.py:1201-1210`  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Time:** ~1 hour

**Problem:**
- Request IDs added to `_inflight_reqs` set at line 897
- Never removed anywhere in codebase
- Caused unbounded memory growth

**Solution:**
```python
finally:
    # WEEK 1 FIX #2 (2025-10-21): Clean up _inflight_reqs to prevent memory leak
    try:
        _inflight_reqs.discard(req_id)  # Use discard (not remove) to avoid KeyError
        logger.debug(f"Removed {req_id} from _inflight_reqs (remaining: {len(_inflight_reqs)})")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to remove {req_id} from _inflight_reqs: {e}", exc_info=True)
    
    # ... rest of finally block with semaphore cleanup ...
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Prevents unbounded memory growth
- ✅ Uses discard() to avoid KeyError if already removed
- ✅ Logs remaining count for monitoring
- ✅ Guaranteed cleanup in finally block

---

### Fix #3: GIL False Safety Claim ✅
**File:** `src/bootstrap/singletons.py:16-24`  
**Severity:** CRITICAL (Documentation)  
**Time:** ~30 minutes

**Problem:**
- Documentation claimed GIL provides thread safety for check-then-act patterns
- This is FALSE - GIL only prevents object corruption
- Misleading documentation could lead to race conditions

**Solution:**
```python
# WEEK 1 FIX #3 (2025-10-21): Corrected misleading GIL documentation
# The GIL prevents corruption of individual Python objects (like booleans)
# The import lock ensures this module is initialized only once per process
# IMPORTANT: The GIL does NOT prevent race conditions in check-then-act patterns
#   within functions called after module import
# Current implementation relies on import lock for safety during module initialization
# For thread-safe post-import calls, proper locking (threading.Lock) would be required
# In practice, these functions are called during startup before concurrent access begins
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Corrects misleading documentation
- ✅ Clarifies actual GIL guarantees
- ✅ Prevents future race condition bugs
- ✅ Sets foundation for Fix #4

---

### Fix #4: Check-Then-Act Race Condition ✅
**File:** `src/bootstrap/singletons.py:27-230`  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Time:** ~30 minutes

**Problem:**
- Three functions had vulnerable check-then-act patterns
- Two threads could both pass check before either sets flag
- Could cause duplicate initialization

**Solution:**
```python
# WEEK 1 FIX #4 (2025-10-21): Add locks to prevent check-then-act race conditions
_providers_lock = threading.Lock()
_tools_lock = threading.Lock()
_provider_tools_lock = threading.Lock()

def ensure_providers_configured() -> None:
    global _providers_configured
    
    # Fast path: no lock needed if already configured
    if _providers_configured:
        logger.debug("Providers already configured, skipping")
        return
    
    # Slow path: acquire lock and double-check
    with _providers_lock:
        # Double-check inside lock
        if _providers_configured:
            logger.debug("Providers already configured (confirmed in lock), skipping")
            return
        
        # ... initialization code ...
        _providers_configured = True
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Prevents race conditions in singleton initialization
- ✅ Double-checked locking pattern (fast path + slow path)
- ✅ Applied to all three initialization functions
- ✅ Thread-safe for concurrent access

---

### Fix #5: No Thread Safety for Providers ✅
**Files:** `src/server/providers/provider_detection.py`, `src/server/providers/provider_registration.py`  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Time:** ~1 hour

**Problem:**
- Provider detection and registration had no thread safety
- Could cause duplicate detection/registration
- No caching of detection results

**Solution:**

**provider_detection.py:**
```python
# WEEK 1 FIX #5 (2025-10-21): Thread safety for provider detection
_detection_lock = threading.Lock()
_detection_complete = False
_cached_provider_config = None

def detect_all_providers() -> dict:
    global _detection_complete, _cached_provider_config
    
    # Fast path: no lock needed if already detected
    if _detection_complete and _cached_provider_config is not None:
        logger.debug("Provider detection already complete, returning cached config")
        return _cached_provider_config
    
    # Slow path: acquire lock and double-check
    with _detection_lock:
        if _detection_complete and _cached_provider_config is not None:
            logger.debug("Provider detection already complete (confirmed in lock), returning cached config")
            return _cached_provider_config
        
        # ... detection logic ...
        _cached_provider_config = result
        _detection_complete = True
        return _cached_provider_config
```

**provider_registration.py:**
```python
# WEEK 1 FIX #5 (2025-10-21): Thread safety for provider registration
_registration_lock = threading.Lock()
_registration_complete = False

def register_providers(provider_config: dict) -> list[str]:
    global _registration_complete
    
    # Fast path: no lock needed if already registered
    if _registration_complete:
        logger.debug("Provider registration already complete, skipping")
        return []
    
    # Slow path: acquire lock and double-check
    with _registration_lock:
        if _registration_complete:
            logger.debug("Provider registration already complete (confirmed in lock), skipping")
            return []
        
        # ... registration logic ...
        _registration_complete = True
        return registered
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Prevents duplicate provider detection
- ✅ Prevents duplicate provider registration
- ✅ Caches detection results for performance
- ✅ Thread-safe for concurrent access
- ✅ Double-checked locking pattern

---

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Fix #1 & #2 Monitoring
- Monitor semaphore values in `logs/ws_daemon.health.json`
- Watch for debug messages: "Released semaphore after timeout"
- Track `_inflight_reqs` size: "Removed {req_id} from _inflight_reqs (remaining: {count})"
- Alert on CRITICAL messages about semaphore release failures

### Fix #3 & #4 Monitoring
- Watch for "already configured" messages (fast path working)
- Monitor for "first-time initialization" messages (slow path)
- No duplicate initialization messages should appear

### Fix #5 Monitoring
- Watch for "Provider detection already complete, returning cached config"
- Monitor for "Provider registration already complete, skipping"
- Verify providers only detected/registered once per startup

## Next Steps

### Week 2 Roadmap (5 HIGH Priority Fixes)
**Estimated Time:** 18-22 hours

1. **Fix #6:** Unsafe Global State Access (provider_config.py)
2. **Fix #7:** Missing Error Handling (provider_config.py)
3. **Fix #8:** Incomplete Cleanup (ws_server.py)
4. **Fix #9:** Race Condition in Session Manager
5. **Fix #10:** Missing Timeout Validation

### Recommendations
1. Continue with Week 2 fixes using same systematic approach
2. Use EXAI for validation and guidance on each fix
3. Test each fix individually before proceeding
4. Monitor production logs for any issues from Week 1 fixes
