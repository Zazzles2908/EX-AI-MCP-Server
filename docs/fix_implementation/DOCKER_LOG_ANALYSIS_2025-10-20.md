- ‚úÖ Session manager: Initialized (timeout=3600s, max_sessions=1)
- ‚úÖ Metrics server: Running on port 8000
- ‚úÖ Monitoring dashboard: Available at http://localhost:8080
- ‚úÖ Health check: Available at http://localhost:8082
- ‚úÖ Providers: Kimi (18 models) + GLM (6 models)
- ‚úÖ Conversation storage: Dual (Supabase + in-memory)
- ‚úÖ **Connection pre-warming: 0.222s** (Supabase: 0.097s, Redis: 0.023s)
- ‚úÖ **Conversation queue: Started** (max_size=1000)
- ‚úÖ **Session semaphore manager: Initialized** (max_concurrent=1, cleanup=300s)
- ‚úÖ Timeout hierarchy validated: daemon=270s, tool=180s (ratio=1.50x)
- ‚úÖ WebSocket daemon: Running on ws://0.0.0.0:8079

**Performance Metrics:**
- Warmup time: 0.222s (excellent!)
- Tool registry build: 1.05s
- Total startup: ~4 seconds

### Request 1: EXAI Consultation (11:15:49 - 11:16:26)

**Timeline:**
- 11:15:49: Connection established
- 11:15:49: Tool call received (chat with continuation_id)
- 11:15:49: Loaded 5 messages (limit=5) ‚úÖ
- 11:15:53: Context pruning: 5/5 messages kept, 3,643 tokens ‚úÖ
- 11:15:53: Generating response (~12,740 tokens) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- 11:15:55: HTTP POST to GLM API
- 11:16:26: Response received (30.4s total)
- 11:16:26: **TOOL_CANCELLED** by client

**Analysis:**
- Context pruning working correctly (3,643 tokens)
- **Prompt was massive** (~12,740 tokens) - this is the issue!
- Response time: 30.4s (reasonable for large prompt)
- Client cancelled before completion

### Request 2: Different Conversation (11:21:08 - 11:26:44)

**Timeline:**
- 11:21:08: New connection (different conversation)
- 11:21:08: Tool call received (no continuation_id - new conversation)
- 11:21:08: Generating response (~723 tokens) ‚úÖ
- 11:21:10: HTTP POST to GLM API
- 11:26:27: **GLM STREAMING TIMEOUT** (300s exceeded, elapsed: 317s) ‚ùå
- 11:26:27: Fallback chain activated
- 11:26:29: Retry HTTP POST to GLM API
- 11:26:44: **SUCCESS** with fallback (16.5s)

**Analysis:**
- First attempt timed out (300s)
- Fallback mechanism worked perfectly
- Retry succeeded in 16.5s
- **This was a different conversation** (not our main one)

### Request 3: EXAI Consultation Retry (11:26:45 - ongoing)

**Timeline:**
- 11:26:45: New connection established
- 11:26:45: Tool call received (same massive prompt as Request 1)
- 11:26:45: Loaded 5 messages (limit=5) ‚úÖ
- 11:26:45: Context pruning: 5/5 messages kept, 3,643 tokens ‚úÖ
- 11:26:45: Generating response (~12,740 tokens) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- 11:26:47: HTTP POST to GLM API
- **Log ends here** - request still processing

**Analysis:**
- Same massive prompt issue (~12,740 tokens)
- Context pruning working (3,643 tokens)
- **Problem is the PROMPT SIZE, not context**

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Issue #1: Conversation Growth (CRITICAL)

**Current State:**
- Conversation e7266172: **30 messages, 290K chars (~72K tokens)**
- Context pruning: Loading only 5 messages (‚úÖ)
- But conversation keeps growing in Supabase

**Impact:**
- Database bloat
- Slower queries over time
- Potential performance degradation

**Root Cause:**
- No message cleanup/archival strategy
- Every turn adds 2 messages (user + assistant)
- Conversation has been running for hours

**Recommendation:**
- Implement conversation archival (move old messages to archive table)
- Add message retention policy (e.g., keep last 50 messages)
- Consider conversation summarization for very long threads

### Issue #2: Massive Prompt Sizes (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Observed:**
- Request 1: ~12,740 tokens in prompt
- Request 3: ~12,740 tokens in prompt (same issue)

**Impact:**
- Long processing times (30+ seconds)
- Risk of timeouts
- Increased API costs

**Root Cause:**
- Agent (me) sending overly verbose EXAI consultations
- Embedding too much data in prompts
- Not using concise communication

**Recommendation:**
- Enforce prompt size limits (< 2K tokens for EXAI)
- Use file attachments instead of embedding data
- Implement prompt compression/summarization

### Issue #3: GLM Timeout (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Observed:**
- Request 2: GLM timeout after 300s (elapsed: 317s)
- Fallback succeeded in 16.5s

**Analysis:**
- Timeout is reasonable (300s = 5 minutes)
- Fallback mechanism working correctly
- **This was a different conversation** with different issue

**Recommendation:**
- Current timeout (300s) is appropriate
- Fallback mechanism is working well
- No changes needed

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING WELL

1. **Infrastructure:**
   - All components initialized successfully
   - Connection pre-warming: 0.222s (excellent!)
   - Session semaphores: Working
   - Async queue: Processing writes

2. **Context Pruning:**
   - Loading only 5 messages (as configured)
   - Token count: 3,643 (under 4K limit)
   - Reduction working correctly

3. **Fallback Mechanism:**
   - Detected timeout correctly
   - Activated fallback chain
   - Retry succeeded quickly (16.5s)

4. **Performance:**
   - Supabase queries: 0.05-0.20s (fast!)
   - Redis operations: < 0.05s (very fast!)
   - Async writes: Fire-and-forget working

## üìà PERFORMANCE METRICS

### Timing Breakdown (Request 1):
- Connection: < 0.1s
- Load messages: 0.063s
- Context pruning: < 0.01s
- GLM API call: 30.4s
- Total: ~30.5s

### Timing Breakdown (Request 2 - Fallback):
- First attempt: 317s (timeout)
- Fallback retry: 16.5s
- Total: 333.5s (but fallback worked!)

### Database Performance:
- Supabase GET: 0.05-0.20s
- Supabase POST: 0.05-0.15s
- Redis operations: < 0.05s

## üéØ RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Fix Prompt Sizes:**
   - Limit EXAI prompts to < 2K tokens
   - Use concise communication
   - Avoid embedding large data blocks

2. **Implement Message Archival:**
   - Create archive table for old messages
   - Move messages older than 7 days to archive
   - Keep last 50 messages in main table

3. **Add Conversation Summarization:**
   - Summarize conversations > 20 messages
   - Store summary in conversation metadata
   - Use summary instead of full history for context

### Future Enhancements:

1. **Adaptive Token Limits:**
   - Different limits for different conversation types
   - Dynamic adjustment based on conversation complexity

2. **Smart Context Selection:**
   - Use semantic similarity to select relevant messages
   - Not just "last N messages"

3. **Conversation Lifecycle Management:**
   - Auto-archive inactive conversations
   - Conversation expiration policies
   - Cleanup old data

## üìä SUPABASE DATA ANALYSIS

**Current Conversation (e7266172-f056-4c38-bc6d-f87b3360447c):**
- Messages: 30 (was 22 earlier)
- Total chars: 290,719 (was 218,765)
- Estimated tokens: ~72,680 (was ~54,691)
- Last message: 2025-10-20 00:27:13 UTC

**Growth Rate:**
- +8 messages in ~15 minutes
- +71,954 chars
- +17,989 tokens

**Projection:**
- At this rate: ~32 messages/hour
- Daily growth: ~768 messages
- **Unsustainable without archival!**

## üèÜ CONCLUSION

**System Health:** üü° **GOOD WITH CAVEATS**

**What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure is solid
- ‚úÖ Context pruning is effective
- ‚úÖ Performance is good
- ‚úÖ Fallback mechanisms work

**What Needs Attention:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Conversation growth (30 messages, 290K chars)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Massive prompt sizes (~12K tokens)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No message archival strategy

**Priority Actions:**
1. Implement message archival (HIGH)
2. Enforce prompt size limits (HIGH)
3. Add conversation summarization (MEDIUM)

**Overall Assessment:**
The system is working as designed, but needs lifecycle management for long-running conversations. The "1-2 minute delay" issue was caused by massive prompts, not system problems.

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Consult EXAI for recommendations
2. Implement message archival
3. Add prompt size validation
4. Test with long-running conversations
