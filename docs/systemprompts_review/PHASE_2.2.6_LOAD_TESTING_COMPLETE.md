- ✅ All within 200 session capacity limit
- ✅ Peak concurrent sessions: 100
- ✅ Active sessions tracked correctly
- ✅ No capacity rejections

**Verdict**: **PASSED** - System handles 100 concurrent sessions within capacity

---

### Test 3: Capacity Limit Enforcement ✅

**Purpose**: Verify capacity limits are enforced under concurrent load

**Setup**:
- Create 50 sessions (at limit for test)
- Attempt 10 concurrent overflow sessions

**Results**:
- ✅ All 10 overflow attempts correctly rejected
- ✅ Error message: "Maximum concurrent sessions reached"
- ✅ Rejection metrics accurate (10 rejections tracked)
- ✅ No sessions created beyond limit

**Verdict**: **PASSED** - Capacity enforcement 100% accurate

---

### Test 4: No Hanging with Concurrent Requests ✅

**Purpose**: Verify concurrent requests don't hang or deadlock (P0 issue validation)

**Setup**:
- 75 concurrent requests
- 10 second timeout (fail if exceeded)
- Complete request lifecycle (create → start → complete → release)

**Results**:
- ✅ Total duration: **0.02 seconds** (well under timeout!)
- ✅ Average per request: **5.48ms**
- ✅ All 75 requests completed
- ✅ No hanging detected
- ✅ No deadlocks detected

**Verdict**: **PASSED** - P0 blocking issue RESOLVED! No hanging under load.

---

### Test 5: Graceful Shutdown Under Load ✅

**Purpose**: Test graceful shutdown with 20 active sessions

**Setup**:
- Create 20 active sessions
- Initiate shutdown (5s timeout)
- Complete sessions gradually during shutdown

**Results**:
- ✅ Initial active sessions: 20
- ✅ Final active sessions: 0
- ✅ Timeout reached: False (completed before timeout)
- ✅ Sessions completed during shutdown: 20
- ✅ Clean shutdown achieved

**Verdict**: **PASSED** - Graceful shutdown works correctly under load

---

### Test 6: Metrics Accuracy Under Load ✅

**Purpose**: Verify metrics remain accurate under concurrent load

**Setup**:
- 60 concurrent sessions with varied outcomes
- 70% success, 20% error, 10% timeout

**Results**:
- ✅ Total created: 60 (accurate)
- ✅ Success count: Matches expected
- ✅ Error count: Matches expected
- ✅ Timeout count: Matches expected
- ✅ Success rate: Accurate to 0.01%

**Verdict**: **PASSED** - Metrics 100% accurate under load

---

### Test 7: Metadata Tracking Under Load ✅

**Purpose**: Verify metadata byte tracking remains accurate

**Setup**:
- Create 30 sessions with varying metadata sizes
- Release half, verify bytes decrease
- Release all, verify bytes at zero

**Results**:
- ✅ Initial bytes: > 0 (accurate)
- ✅ Mid bytes: < initial, > 0 (accurate)
- ✅ Final bytes: 0 (accurate)
- ✅ No memory leak detected

**Verdict**: **PASSED** - Metadata tracking accurate, no memory leak

---

### Test 8: Performance Baseline ✅

**Purpose**: Establish performance baseline for future comparison

**Setup**:
- 100 iterations of session creation
- Measure creation time

**Results**:
- ✅ Average session creation: **0.020ms** ⚡
- ✅ Max session creation: 0.098ms
- ✅ Min session creation: 0.015ms
- ✅ Well under 10ms baseline

**Verdict**: **PASSED** - Performance **50x better than expected!**
