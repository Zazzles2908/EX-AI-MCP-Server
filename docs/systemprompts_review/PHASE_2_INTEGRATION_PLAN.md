# Phase 2 Integration Plan

**Created:** 2025-10-21  
**Purpose:** Document integration tasks deferred from Phase 1

---

## Overview

Phase 1 created foundational components that are **functionally complete** but not yet integrated into the main request flow. Phase 2 will integrate these components into production use.

---

## Deferred Integration Tasks

### 1. Unified Provider Interface Integration

**Status:** Core implementation complete (Phase 1.4)  
**File:** `src/providers/unified_interface.py` (348 lines)  
**Deferred Work:** Migrate existing provider-specific code to use unified interface

#### Integration Tasks:

1. **Inventory Current Provider Code**
   - Locate all direct provider API calls
   - Identify provider-specific error handling
   - Map current code to adapter pattern

2. **Migration Strategy**
   - Replace direct Kimi/GLM calls with UnifiedProviderInterface
   - Update error handling to use standardized format
   - Migrate format_prompt() calls to use adapters

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - Test all provider integrations through unified interface
   - Verify error handling works correctly
   - Validate format conversions (messages vs concatenated)

4. **Rollback Plan**
   - Keep old provider code temporarily
   - Gradual migration with feature flags
   - Monitor for regressions

#### Files to Modify:
```
src/providers/kimi.py - Replace direct calls with KimiAdapter
src/providers/glm.py - Replace direct calls with GLMAdapter
src/server/request_handler.py - Use UnifiedProviderInterface
tools/workflows/*.py - Update provider interactions
```

#### Success Criteria:
- ✅ All provider calls go through unified interface
- ✅ Error handling uses standardized format
- ✅ No direct SDK calls outside adapters
- ✅ All tests pass with new interface

### 2. Capability-Aware Routing Integration

**Status:** Core implementation complete (Phase 1.5)  
**File:** `src/providers/capability_router.py` (415 lines)  
**Deferred Work:** Integrate with main request handler

#### Integration Tasks:

1. **Request Handler Integration**
   - Add capability router to request flow
   - Implement automatic provider selection
   - Add routing decision logging

2. **Fallback Routing**
   - Implement fallback when primary provider unavailable
   - Add circuit breaker for provider failures
   - Create degraded execution paths

3. **Request Flow Updates**
   - Route requests based on tool requirements
   - Select optimal provider for each request
   - Log routing decisions for monitoring

4. **Testing Requirements**
   - Test all execution paths (direct, standard, streaming, thinking, vision, file_upload)
   - Verify provider selection logic
   - Test fallback scenarios

#### Files to Modify:
```
src/server/request_handler.py - Add capability routing
src/server/daemon.py - Initialize capability router
tools/base.py - Use routing decisions
src/monitoring/metrics.py - Track routing metrics
```

#### Success Criteria:
- ✅ Requests automatically routed based on capabilities
- ✅ Optimal provider selected for each tool
- ✅ Fallback routing works for provider failures
- ✅ Routing decisions logged to Supabase

## Integration Order

**Recommended Sequence:**

1. **Phase 2.1:** Unified Provider Interface (1-2 days)
   - Lower risk, clear migration path
   - Provides foundation for routing integration

2. **Phase 2.2:** Capability-Aware Routing (2-3 days)
   - Depends on unified interface
   - Requires request handler changes

3. **Phase 2.3:** Monitoring & Validation (1 day)
   - Add metrics collection
   - Validate end-to-end flow
   - Performance testing

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk:
- Unified interface migration (clear adapter pattern)
- Capability matrix updates (data-driven)

### Medium Risk:
- Request handler integration (core flow changes)
- Routing logic integration (affects all requests)

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Comprehensive testing before deployment
- Rollback plan for each integration
- Monitor metrics closely during rollout

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:
- Test each adapter independently
- Test routing logic with all tool types
- Test fallback scenarios

### Integration Tests:
- Test full request flow with unified interface
- Test routing decisions for all tools
- Test provider failover

### Performance Tests:
- Measure routing overhead
- Compare latency before/after integration
- Validate token efficiency maintained

---

## Success Metrics

### Unified Interface:
- 100% of provider calls through adapters
- 0 direct SDK calls outside unified_interface.py
- Error handling standardized across providers

### Capability Routing:
- Routing decisions logged for all requests
- Optimal provider selected based on capabilities
- Fallback routing working for failures

### Overall:
- No performance regression
- Token efficiency maintained (49-62%)
- All tests passing
- Production deployment successful
