# Task B: Documentation Organization Plan
**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Status:** AWAITING EXAI VALIDATION  
**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

## üéØ OBJECTIVE

Consolidate and organize documentation structure by:
1. Moving essential docs to `docs/` root
2. Consolidating redundant files in `docs/project-status/`
3. Archiving old/superseded content
4. Creating clear navigation structure

---

## üìä CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### docs/ Root (4 files)
- `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` - Index of all docs
- `KIMI_DESIGN_CONTEXT.md` - Design context for Kimi
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `CURRENT_STATUS.md` - NEW - Current status (just created)

### docs/project-status/ (20+ files)
**Active/Recent:**
- `ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT_CRITICAL.md` - Critical issues tracker
- `FIXES_CHECKLIST.md` - Fix tracking
- `GLM_WEB_SEARCH_FINAL_ANALYSIS_2025-10-04.md` - Latest investigation
- `ARCHITECTURE_FLOW_SERVER_STARTUP.md` - Architecture doc

**Redundant/Superseded:**
- Multiple web search investigation files (5+)
- Multiple session progress files (3+)
- Multiple summary files (4+)
- Wave 3 files (2)
- Validation reports (1)

### Other Directories
- `docs/system-reference/` - Architecture docs (KEEP)
- `docs/guides/` - User guides (KEEP)

## üîß PROPOSED ORGANIZATION

### Phase 1: Root Level Structure

**Keep in docs/ root:**
```
docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                    # Project overview
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CURRENT_STATUS.md            # Single source of truth for status
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md       # Complete index
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ KIMI_DESIGN_CONTEXT.md       # Design context
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ QUICK_START.md               # NEW - Quick start guide
```

### Phase 2: Consolidate project-status/

**Keep (5 files):**
```
docs/project-status/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT_CRITICAL.md           # Critical issues
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FIXES_CHECKLIST.md                       # Fix tracking
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ARCHITECTURE_FLOW_SERVER_STARTUP.md      # Architecture
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GLM_WEB_SEARCH_FINAL_ANALYSIS_2025-10-04.md  # Latest investigation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ COMPREHENSIVE_TOOL_TESTING_2025-10-03.md # Test results
```

**Archive (15+ files):**
```
docs/archive/project-status-2025-10-04/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AGENTIC_ROUTING_FIX.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BUG_FIX_REPORT_2025-10-03.md

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WAVE_3_PREPARATION.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WEB_SEARCH_AUDIT.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WEB_SEARCH_INVESTIGATION_2025-10-03.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WEB_SEARCH_RAG_FIX.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WEB_SEARCH_TEST_RESULTS_2025-10-03.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [subdirectories: progress/, readiness/, summaries/]
```

### Phase 3: Organize Other Directories

**docs/guides/ (KEEP AS-IS):**
- User-facing guides
- Well organized
- No changes needed

**docs/system-reference/ (KEEP AS-IS):**
- Architecture documentation
- Well organized
- No changes needed

**docs/features/, docs/technical/, docs/reviews/, docs/ux/:**
- Review and consolidate if needed
- Move to archive if superseded

### Phase 4: Create New Essential Docs

**docs/QUICK_START.md:**
```markdown
# Quick Start Guide
- Installation
- Basic usage
- Common tasks
- Troubleshooting
```

**docs/CONTRIBUTING.md:**
```markdown
# Contributing Guide
- Development setup
- Code standards
- Testing requirements
- PR process
```

## üîç VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

### EXAI Codereview Should Validate:

1. **Information Loss:**
   - Are we archiving anything that should be kept?
   - Is there unique information in files we're archiving?
   - Should we consolidate before archiving?

2. **File Selection:**
   - Are the 5 files we're keeping the right ones?
   - Should we keep more or fewer?
   - Are there dependencies between files?

3. **Archive Strategy:**
   - Is the archive location appropriate?
   - Should we create an index of archived files?
   - How to make archived content discoverable?

4. **Navigation:**
   - Will users be able to find what they need?
   - Is the structure intuitive?
   - Should we add more index files?

5. **Maintenance:**
   - How to prevent docs from getting messy again?
   - Should we add a docs maintenance guide?
   - What's the process for adding new docs?

6. **Consolidation Opportunities:**
   - Should we merge similar files before archiving?
   - Are there duplicate sections across files?
   - Can we extract common content?

7. **Alternative Approaches:**
   - Is there a better organization structure?
   - Should we use a different directory layout?
   - Should we use a docs generator tool?

- Useful for context but not current

**Session Files (3):**
- Historical progress tracking
- Superseded by CURRENT_STATUS.md
- Archive for history

**Summary Files (4):**
- Point-in-time summaries
- Superseded by current docs
- Archive for reference

**Wave 3 Files (2):**

## üö® RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Losing Important Information

### Risk 3: User Confusion
**Mitigation:** Clear README.md, updated DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md, migration guide

### Risk 4: Reverting to Messy State
**Mitigation:** Create docs maintenance guide, establish clear rules for new docs

## üìù NOTES FOR EXAI REVIEW

**Key Questions:**
1. Is this organization structure optimal?
2. Are we keeping the right files?
3. Should we consolidate before archiving?
4. Is there a better way to organize project-status/?
5. Should we create more index files?
6. How to prevent docs from getting messy again?
7. Are there any files we're archiving that should be kept?

**Context:**
- Current structure has grown organically
- Many files are historical/superseded
- Need balance between history and usability
- Want to make it easy for new contributors
- Need to maintain searchability of archived content
