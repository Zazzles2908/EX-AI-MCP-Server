# Post-Week 3 Enhancements & Future Improvements

**Created:** 2025-10-05  
**Status:** 📋 PLANNING - To be executed after Week 3 completion  
**Priority:** P3-P4 (Nice-to-have, non-critical improvements)  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 weeks (can be done incrementally)

---

## 🎯 PURPOSE

This document captures improvements, enhancements, and technical debt items discovered during the Week 1-3 Master Fix Implementation that should be addressed in future iterations but are not critical for production readiness.

---

## 📊 OVERVIEW

During Week 1-3, we focused on **critical (P0) and high-priority (P1) fixes** to make the system production-ready. Several **medium (P2) and low-priority (P3) items** were identified but deferred to avoid scope creep and maintain focus on core functionality.

**Categories:**
1. **Configuration Standardization** - MCP config consistency across clients
2. **Web Search Verification** - Validate GLM and Kimi native web search
3. **Continuation System Simplification** - Optional continuation_id, cleaner responses
4. **Script Consolidation** - Organize scattered scripts (see SCRIPT_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md)
5. **Bootstrap Module Enhancements** - Add validation and error handling
6. **Session Management Enhancements** - Activity tracking integration, periodic cleanup
7. **Monitoring & Metrics** - Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
8. **Documentation Improvements** - API docs, deployment guides, troubleshooting

---

## 1. CONFIGURATION STANDARDIZATION

### Issue
Three different MCP configurations (Auggie, Augment, Claude) have inconsistent timeout and concurrency settings with no clear documentation of why differences exist.

### Current State
- `Daemon/mcp-config.auggie.json` - Auggie CLI config
- `Daemon/mcp-config.augmentcode.json` - VSCode Augment config
- `Daemon/mcp-config.claude.json` - Claude Desktop config
- Each has different values, unclear rationale

### Proposed Solution
1. **Create base configuration** with sensible defaults
2. **Document client-specific overrides** with rationale
3. **Standardize timeout values** across all clients
4. **Add configuration validation** on startup
5. **Test all three configurations** regularly

### Files Affected
- `Daemon/mcp-config.auggie.json`
- `Daemon/mcp-config.augmentcode.json`
- `Daemon/mcp-config.claude.json`
- `config.py` (add validation)

### Estimated Effort
- **Time:** 1-2 days
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Risk:** Medium (could break client connections if not careful)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All three configs use consistent timeout hierarchy
- [ ] Differences documented with clear rationale
- [ ] Configuration validation added
- [ ] All three clients tested and working
- [ ] Documentation updated

## 2. WEB SEARCH VERIFICATION

### Issue
Web search implementation (GLM and Kimi native) exists but lacks verification, logging, and tests. Unclear if it's actually being used.

### Current State
- GLM: Native web search via tools schema (hidden from registry)
- Kimi: Builtin `$web_search` function
- Auto-injection logic exists in SimpleTool.execute()
- No logging of web search activation
- No tests verifying web search works

### Proposed Solution
1. **Add logging** when web search is activated
2. **Create integration tests** for GLM and Kimi web search
3. **Document web search flow** in architecture docs
4. **Add metrics** for web search usage
5. **Verify web search works** in both providers

### Files Affected
- `server.py` (line 260, glm_web_search)
- `tools/simple/base.py` (lines 502-508, auto-injection)
- `src/providers/capabilities.py` (lines 45-81, schemas)
- `src/providers/orchestration/websearch_adapter.py`
- `tests/integration/test_web_search.py` (NEW)

### Estimated Effort
- **Time:** 2-3 days
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Risk:** Low (verification only, no breaking changes)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Web search activation logged
- [ ] Integration tests created (GLM and Kimi)
- [ ] Web search flow documented
- [ ] Metrics added for usage tracking
- [ ] Verified working in both providers

---

## 3. CONTINUATION SYSTEM SIMPLIFICATION

### Issue
Simple tools return continuation_id structure even for single-turn operations, making output verbose and confusing.

### Current State
```json
{
  "status": "continuation_available",
  "content": "...",
  "continuation_offer": {
    "continuation_id": "...",
    "note": "You can continue...",
    "remaining_turns": 19
  }
}
```

### Proposed Solution
1. **Make continuation_id optional** based on request parameter
2. **Move metadata to separate field** (not in content)
3. **Only include continuation_offer** when conversation mode active
4. **Simplify response format** for single-turn operations

### Files Affected
- `tools/simple/base.py` (lines 400-500, response formatting)
- `tools/simple/mixins/continuation_mixin.py`
- `scripts/run_ws_shim.py` (lines 60-75, response cleaning)

### Estimated Effort
- **Time:** 1-2 days
- **Difficulty:** Low
- **Risk:** Low (backward compatible)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Continuation_id optional (default: false)
- [ ] Metadata in separate field
- [ ] Continuation_offer only when requested
- [ ] Simplified single-turn responses
- [ ] Backward compatible with existing clients

Session management cleanup implemented (Week 2, Day 11-12) but integration with WebSocket server not yet complete.

### Current State
- SessionManager has lifecycle management
- Session timeout and cleanup implemented
- Session limits enforcement working
- **Missing:** Activity tracking integration, periodic cleanup task

### Proposed Solution
1. **Integrate activity tracking** in ws_server.py
   - Call `update_activity()` on each message received
   - Prevents premature timeout of active sessions

2. **Add periodic cleanup task**
   - Background task to cleanup stale sessions
   - Runs every SESSION_CLEANUP_INTERVAL seconds
   - Logs cleanup events

3. **Enhance metrics**
   - Add session creation/destruction events
   - Track session duration distribution
   - Export metrics for monitoring

4. **Add session persistence** (optional)
   - Optional session persistence to disk
   - Restore sessions on server restart
   - Useful for long-running sessions

### Files Affected
- `src/daemon/ws_server.py` (add activity tracking, cleanup task)
- `src/daemon/session_manager.py` (enhance metrics)

### Estimated Effort
- **Time:** 1 day
- **Difficulty:** Low
- **Risk:** Low (enhancement only)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Activity tracking integrated in ws_server.py
- [ ] Periodic cleanup task running
- [ ] Enhanced metrics collection
- [ ] Session persistence (optional)
- [ ] All integration tests passing
