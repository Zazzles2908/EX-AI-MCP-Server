## CRITICAL CONTEXT

### What Works Well
1. **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests first, then implement
2. **Incremental Changes** - Small, focused changes with immediate testing
3. **Comprehensive Documentation** - Document as you go
4. **Pattern Consistency** - Follow established patterns from Week 1-2

### What to Avoid
1. **Breaking Changes** - Don't modify Week 1-2 code unless fixing bugs
2. **Skipping Tests** - Always run tests after changes
3. **Incomplete Documentation** - Document everything
4. **Rushing** - Take time to do it right

### Integration Points to Test
1. **WebSocket Server** (`src/daemon/ws_server.py`)
   - Uses SessionManager
   - Uses timeout configuration
   - Uses unified logging
   - Uses graceful degradation

2. **Expert Analysis** (`src/tools/expert_analysis.py`)
   - Uses deduplication cache
   - Uses timeout configuration
   - Uses progress heartbeat
   - Uses unified logging

3. **Configuration** (`config.py`)
   - Loaded by all components
   - Validated on startup
   - Environment variable precedence

4. **Logging** (`utils/logging_unified.py`)
   - Used by all components
   - Request ID tracking
   - Structured JSONL format
