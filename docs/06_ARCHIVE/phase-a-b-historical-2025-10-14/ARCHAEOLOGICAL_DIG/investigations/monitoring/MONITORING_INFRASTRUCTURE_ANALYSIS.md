## DESIGN INTENT

### Expected Capabilities

**Health Monitoring:**
- Track daemon health
- Track provider health
- Track tool execution health
- Alert on failures

**Metrics Collection:**
- Request latency
- Token usage
- Error rates
- Provider availability

**Auto-Scaling:**
- Scale workers based on load
- Optimize resource usage
- Handle traffic spikes

**Predictive Analytics:**
- Predict failures
- Identify bottlenecks
- Optimize performance

**SLO Tracking:**
- Define service level objectives
- Track compliance
- Alert on violations

---

## CONNECTION ANALYSIS

### Where Should Monitoring Connect?

**1. WebSocket Daemon (src/daemon/ws_server.py)**
- Track connection count
- Monitor message throughput
- Measure latency

**2. Request Handler (src/server/handlers/request_handler.py)**
- Track tool execution time
- Monitor error rates
- Measure provider latency

**3. Providers (src/providers/)**
- Track API call latency
- Monitor rate limits
- Track token usage

**4. Tools (tools/)**
- Track execution time
- Monitor success/failure rates
- Measure resource usage

## INVESTIGATION TASKS

### Task 1: Check Current Usage
- [ ] Search for `from monitoring import` in codebase
- [ ] Search for `import monitoring` in codebase
- [ ] Check if any monitoring is active
- [ ] Identify entry points

### Task 2: Read Integration Plan
- [ ] Read monitoring_integration_plan.md
- [ ] Understand design intent
- [ ] Identify planned vs implemented features
- [ ] Document gaps

### Task 3: Check Health Monitor Integration
- [ ] Is health_monitor.py used by daemon?
- [ ] Is health_monitor.py used by providers?
- [ ] Are health checks exposed via API?
- [ ] Are health metrics logged?

### Task 4: Check Telemetry Integration
- [ ] Is telemetry.py collecting metrics?
- [ ] Where are metrics stored?
- [ ] Are metrics exposed for visualization?
- [ ] Integration with logs/?

### Task 5: Check Auto-Scaling
- [ ] Is autoscale.py active?
- [ ] Is worker_pool.py managing workers?
- [ ] Are workers scaled based on load?
- [ ] Configuration in .env?

## PRELIMINARY FINDINGS

### Finding 1: Comprehensive Monitoring System Exists
- ✅ 9 monitoring scripts
- ✅ Covers health, metrics, scaling, SLOs
- ✅ Integration plan documented
- ❓ Unknown if active or planned

### Finding 2: Sophisticated Features
**Advanced capabilities:**
- Predictive monitoring
- Auto-scaling
- SLO tracking
- Telemetry collection

**This suggests:**
- Well-thought-out design
- Enterprise-grade monitoring
- May be planned for future

### Finding 3: Potential Overlap with Logging
**Question:** How does monitoring/ relate to:
- `.logs/` folder?
- `logs/` folder?
- `src/utils/async_logging.py`?

**Need to understand:**
- Monitoring vs logging separation
- Are they integrated?
- Should they be integrated?

---

## CRITICAL QUESTIONS

### 1. Is Monitoring Active?
**Check:**
- Are monitoring scripts imported?
- Are metrics being collected?
- Are health checks running?

### 2. Where Are Metrics Stored?
**Options:**
- File-based (file_sink.py)?
- Supabase?
- External service (Prometheus, Datadog)?
- Not stored (planned for future)?

### 3. How Does It Integrate with Logs?
**Questions:**
- Are logs and metrics separate?
- Should they be unified?
- Is observability centralized?

### 4. Configuration
**Check .env for:**
- MONITORING_ENABLED?
- HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL?
- METRICS_SINK?
- TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT?

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS (PRELIMINARY)

### Phase 1: Determine Status (Immediate)

**Action:** Check if monitoring is active

**Search for imports:**
```bash
grep -r "from monitoring import" .
grep -r "import monitoring" .
```

**Check .env:**
```bash
grep "MONITORING" .env
grep "HEALTH" .env
grep "TELEMETRY" .env
```

### Phase 2: Read Integration Plan

**Action:** Read monitoring_integration_plan.md

**Understand:**
- What was planned?
- What was implemented?
- What's missing?
- What's the timeline?

### Phase 3: Integration Strategy

**If Active:**
- Verify metrics are being collected
- Check health endpoints
- Review telemetry data
- Optimize configuration

**If Planned:**
- Prioritize features
- Create activation plan
- Define metrics to track
- Set up dashboards

### Phase 4: Unify Observability

**Combine:**
- Monitoring (metrics, health)
- Logging (events, errors)
- Tracing (request flow)

**Into:**
- Unified observability platform
- Single source of truth
- Centralized dashboards

1. **Immediate:** Search for monitoring imports
2. **Then:** Read monitoring_integration_plan.md
3. **Then:** Check .env for monitoring config
4. **Then:** Determine active vs planned
5. **Finally:** Recommend integration strategy
