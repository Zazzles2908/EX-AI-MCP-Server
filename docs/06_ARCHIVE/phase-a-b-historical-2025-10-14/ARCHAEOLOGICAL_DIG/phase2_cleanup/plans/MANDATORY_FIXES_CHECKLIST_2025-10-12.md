# MANDATORY FIXES CHECKLIST - EXAI WORKFLOWTOOLS
**Date:** 2025-10-12 10:25 AM AEDT (12th October 2025, Saturday)
**Type:** Actionable Checklist - Required Before EXAI Usage
**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL - BLOCKING EXAI DEVELOPMENT
**Status:** ‚è≥ NOT STARTED

---

## üéØ PURPOSE

This checklist contains **MANDATORY fixes** that MUST be completed before EXAI tools can be reliably used for WorkflowTool development and testing.

**Why These Fixes Are Mandatory:**
1. **EXAI tools lack model capability awareness** - Agent cannot make informed decisions
2. **Daemon crashes prevent EXAI usage** - System is unstable
3. **Core functionality disabled** - 4 tools have file inclusion disabled
4. **State leakage risks** - Tools may behave unpredictably
5. **Security vulnerabilities** - Validation logic is misplaced
