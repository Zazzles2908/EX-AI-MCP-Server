- **DUPLICATE** - Multiple versions of same functionality
- **PLANNED** - Exists but not yet integrated

---

9. ‚úÖ Task 1.9: Src Duplicates Investigation

**Pending:**

---

## üîç INVESTIGATION RESULTS

### Task 1.1: System Prompts ‚úÖ ACTIVE - FULLY INTEGRATED

**Evidence:**
- 14 active imports in tools/ (workflows + chat)
- Execution flow confirmed: import ‚Üí get_system_prompt() ‚Üí provider.generate_content()
- No hardcoded bypass detected
- System working as designed

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ KEEP - No changes needed

---

### Task 1.2: Timezone Utility ‚úÖ ACTIVE - IN USE

**Evidence:**
- 2 active imports found
- Used by provider_diagnostics.py for Melbourne timestamps
- Test script exists (scripts/test_timezone.py)
- Adds timestamps to logs/provider_registry_snapshot.json

**Bonus Fix:**
- Fixed EXAI codereview error: removed redundant `import time` in expert_analysis.py line 418
- This was causing "cannot access local variable 'time'" error
- All workflow tools should now work correctly

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ KEEP - Active and working

---

### Task 1.3: Model Routing ‚úÖ ACTIVE - WORKING AS DESIGNED

**Evidence:**
- 2 providers registered (KIMI, GLM)
- 22 models available
- Clean 3-module architecture (1,079 lines)
- Environment-driven preference system via KIMI_PREFERRED_MODELS/GLM_PREFERRED_MODELS
- kimi-latest-128k selected because KIMI_PREFERRED_MODELS not set (correct behavior)

**Solution Identified:**
- Add KIMI_PREFERRED_MODELS=kimi-k2-0905-preview,... to .env

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ KEEP - Working correctly, just needs .env configuration

---

### Task 1.4: Utils Folder Audit ‚úÖ ACTIVE - NEEDS REORGANIZATION

**Files Checked:** 37 Python files

**Evidence:**
- 25 files confirmed ACTIVE (68%)
- 12 files need verification (32%)
- 0 files orphaned
- Top imports: 
  - progress.py (24 imports)
  - observability.py (18 imports)
  - conversation_memory.py (15 imports)
  - model_context.py (14 imports)

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ KEEP ALL - Reorganize into folders:
- file/ (file utilities)
- conversation/ (conversation management)
- model/ (model utilities)
- config/ (configuration)
- infrastructure/ (observability, health, metrics)

---

### Task 1.5: Monitoring Infrastructure ‚ö†Ô∏è PLANNED - NOT ACTIVE

**Evidence:**
- 0 imports across entire codebase
- No .env configuration (MONITORING_ENABLED, HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL, METRICS_SINK all missing)
- 9 files exist (8 Python + 1 markdown plan)
- __pycache__ exists (tested but not integrated)

**Redundancy:**
- Functionality overlaps with utils/observability.py, utils/health.py, utils/metrics.py

**Recommendation:** üóëÔ∏è DELETE or ARCHIVE - Redundant with existing utils

---

### Task 1.6: Security/RBAC ‚ö†Ô∏è PLANNED - NOT ACTIVE

**Evidence:**
- 0 imports across entire codebase
- No .env configuration (RBAC_ENABLED, AUTH_ENABLED missing)
- 2 files exist (rbac.py, rbac_config.py)
- __pycache__ exists (tested but not integrated)

**Context:**
- Single-user system, RBAC not needed

**Recommendation:** üóëÔ∏è DELETE or ARCHIVE - Not needed for single-user system

---

### Task 1.7: Streaming ‚ö†Ô∏è MIXED

**Evidence:**
- streaming/: 1 file (streaming_adapter.py), 0 imports, PLANNED
- tools/streaming/: EMPTY directory (only __pycache__)
- No .env configuration (STREAMING_ENABLED missing)

**Recommendation:** 
- üóëÔ∏è DELETE tools/streaming/ (empty)
- ü§î KEEP or DELETE streaming/ (not integrated, decide based on future plans)

---

### Task 1.8: Tools Structure ‚úÖ ACTIVE - DIFFERENT PURPOSES (NOT DUPLICATES)

**Evidence:**
- tools/workflow/ = BASE CLASSES (WorkflowTool, mixins)
- tools/workflows/ = IMPLEMENTATIONS (12 workflow tools)
- tools/streaming/ = EMPTY (delete)
- tools/providers/ = UNKNOWN (needs investigation)

**Recommendation:** 
- ‚úÖ KEEP workflow/ and workflows/ (different purposes, not duplicates)
- üóëÔ∏è DELETE tools/streaming/

---

### Task 1.9: Src Duplicates ‚ö†Ô∏è MIXED - ORPHANED + EMPTY + DIFFERENT PURPOSES

**Evidence:**
- src/conf/ = ORPHANED (1 file: custom_models.json, 0 imports)
- src/config/ = ORPHANED (only __pycache__, 0 imports)
- src/conversation/ = ACTIVE (4 files, used by system)
- src/server/conversation/ = EMPTY
- src/providers/ = ACTIVE (implementations)
- src/server/providers/ = DIFFERENT PURPOSE (configuration)
- src/utils/ = ACTIVE (2 files: timezone.py, async_logging.py)
- utils/ = ACTIVE (37 files: tool utilities)

**Recommendation:**
- üóëÔ∏è DELETE src/conf/ (orphaned)
- üóëÔ∏è DELETE src/config/ (orphaned)
- üóëÔ∏è DELETE src/server/conversation/ (empty)
- ‚úÖ KEEP all others (active or different purposes)

---
