## üéØ KEY CONCEPTS TO UNDERSTAND

### 1. Top-Down Design (Stepwise Refinement)

**What it means:**
- Start from entry points (User ‚Üí IDE ‚Üí MCP ‚Üí Daemon ‚Üí Tools)
- Organize by **conceptual responsibility** (what it represents)
- NOT by implementation details (what code does)
- Use **domain language** that matches the problem domain

**Example:**
- ‚ùå Bottom-Up: `prompt/builder.py` (what code does)
- ‚úÖ Top-Down: `preparation/prompt.py` (what concept it represents)

### 2. Conceptual Categories (Option C - Hybrid)

**SimpleTool organized by 5 conceptual categories:**

1. **definition/** - "What does this tool promise?" (Tool contract)
2. **intake/** - "What did the user ask for?" (Request processing)
3. **preparation/** - "How do we ask the AI?" (Prompt building)
4. **execution/** - "How do we call the AI?" (Model invocation)
5. **delivery/** - "How do we deliver the result?" (Response formatting)

**Why this works:**
- Matches the docstring flow: "1. Receive request, 2. Prepare prompt, 3. Call AI, 4. Format response"
- Uses domain language (easy to understand)
- Clear conceptual boundaries
- 7 files (5 folders) instead of 9 files (6 folders) - SIMPLER!

### 3. Facade Pattern

**What it means:**
- SimpleTool keeps ALL public methods (same signatures)
- Delegates to conceptual modules for implementation
- 100% backward compatibility - no breaking changes

**Example:**
```python
class SimpleTool:
    def build_standard_prompt(self, ...):
        from tools.simple.preparation.prompt import PromptBuilder
        return PromptBuilder.build_standard(...)
```

### 4. TRUE Top-Down Flow

**Complete system flow:**
```
User ‚Üí Augment IDE ‚Üí MCP Server ‚Üí WebSocket Daemon ‚Üí Tool Registry ‚Üí
Tool Frameworks (SimpleTool/WorkflowTool) ‚Üí Base Infrastructure ‚Üí AI Providers
```

**Key insight:** Refactoring should follow this flow, not bottom-up code splitting!

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT TO LOOK FOR DURING REVIEW

### 1. Does the approach make sense?

- **Top-Down Design:** Does organizing by conceptual categories make more sense than implementation details?
- **Conceptual Categories:** Do the 5 categories (definition, intake, preparation, execution, delivery) make sense?
- **Domain Language:** Are the names clear and understandable?

### 2. Is the SimpleTool plan solid?

- **Dependency Analysis:** Do we understand what depends on SimpleTool?
- **Public Interface:** Are we preserving all necessary methods?
- **Module Breakdown:** Does each module have a clear, single responsibility?
- **Migration Strategy:** Is the approach incremental and safe?

### 3. Can we execute this?

- **Effort Estimates:** Are the time estimates realistic?
- **Risk Assessment:** Have we identified all risks?
- **Success Criteria:** Are the success criteria clear and measurable?

### 4. Is the documentation clear?

- **Diagrams:** Do the visual diagrams help understand the architecture?
- **Examples:** Are there enough examples to understand the approach?
- **Consistency:** Is the terminology consistent across all documents?

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS AFTER REVIEW

**After you review the documentation:**

1. **Provide feedback** on the Top-Down Design approach
2. **Ask questions** about anything unclear
3. **Approve or request changes** to the plan
4. **Decide:** Should we proceed with SimpleTool refactoring?

**If approved:**
- We'll start Phase 1.1: Document Design Intent for other large files
- Then Phase 1.3: Refactor SimpleTool Framework using Top-Down Design (Option C)
