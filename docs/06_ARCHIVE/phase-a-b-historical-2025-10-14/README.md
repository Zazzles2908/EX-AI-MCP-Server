## Why Archive Now?

This archiving was originally deferred during Phase C Task C.2 (Documentation Consolidation) to avoid disrupting active work. The note in `C2_DOCUMENTATION_CONSOLIDATION_EVIDENCE.md` stated:

> "Archiving deferred to avoid disrupting current work. Can be done in Phase D or as separate task."

During Phase C completion verification, we identified this as **Deferred Item #2** that needed to be addressed before concluding the project. The user requested we address all deferred items (Option A), so this archiving is being completed now.

## How to Access Archived Content

If you need to reference archived content:

1. **Location:** `docs/archive/phase-a-b-historical-2025-10-14/`
2. **Structure:** Original directory structure preserved
3. **Search:** Use grep/ripgrep to search across archived files
4. **Context:** Read this README first to understand what each directory contains

### Example: Finding Historical Issue Analysis

```bash
# Search for specific issue in archived reviews
grep -r "auth token" docs/archive/phase-a-b-historical-2025-10-14/reviews/

# Find old checklist items
grep -r "Task A.1" docs/archive/phase-a-b-historical-2025-10-14/checklist/

# Search archaeological dig for design decisions
grep -r "provider architecture" docs/archive/phase-a-b-historical-2025-10-14/ARCHAEOLOGICAL_DIG/
```

1. **Create dated archive directory:** `docs/archive/[purpose]-YYYY-MM-DD/`
2. **Move directories (not delete):** Preserve original structure
3. **Create README:** Document what, why, when, and how to access
4. **Update references:** Update any docs that referenced archived content
5. **Verify integrity:** Confirm all files moved successfully
