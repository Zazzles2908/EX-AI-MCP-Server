## 📊 Phase C Achievements

### Task C.1: Performance Benchmarking ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Duration:** 2 hours  
**Evidence:** `docs/consolidated_checklist/evidence/C1_PERFORMANCE_BENCHMARKING_EVIDENCE.md`

**What Was Accomplished:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive benchmark suite (`scripts/testing/benchmark_performance.py`)
- ✅ Established performance baseline from Phase B testing data
- ✅ Identified optimization opportunities (none critical)
- ✅ Validated memory usage (no leaks)
- ✅ Compared multi-provider performance (GLM and Kimi)

**Key Findings:**
