# Always-Up Proxy Implementation
**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Pattern:** Never-Exit Auto-Reconnect Proxy

---

## üéØ The Problem

**Augment/VS Code MCP Limitation:**
- MCP servers are started via command in `mcp-config.augmentcode.json`
- Augment resolves and runs this command **only once** at startup
- If the connection breaks (Docker restart), Augment does NOT re-run the command
- User must manually toggle Augment settings to restart the MCP server

**Our Scenario:**
```
Augment ‚Üí Python Shim (stdio) ‚Üí WebSocket ‚Üí Docker Daemon (port 8079)
```

When Docker restarts:
1. WebSocket connection breaks
2. Shim detects failure
3. **OLD**: Shim exits with `sys.exit(0)`, hoping Augment restarts it
4. **REALITY**: Augment doesn't restart until user toggles settings
5. **RESULT**: Manual intervention required ‚ùå

---

## üí° The Solution: Always-Up Proxy Pattern

**Core Principle:**
The shim process **never exits**. When connection fails, it just keeps retrying until Docker comes back.

**Why This Works:**
- Shim process stays alive (Augment never knows connection broke)
- When Docker restarts, shim automatically reconnects
- From Augment's perspective, nothing changed
- **Zero manual intervention required** ‚úÖ

## üîß Implementation Details

### Modified Function: `_ensure_ws()`

**Location:** `scripts/run_ws_shim.py` (lines 263-356)

**Old Behavior:**
```python
async def _ensure_ws():
    # Try to connect with timeout
    deadline = time() + 30  # 30 second timeout
    while time() < deadline:
        try:
            _ws = await websockets.connect(uri)
            return _ws
        except Exception:
            await asyncio.sleep(backoff)
    
    # Timeout reached - give up!
    raise RuntimeError("Failed to connect after 30s")
```

**New Behavior:**
```python
async def _ensure_ws():
    """ALWAYS-UP PROXY PATTERN - Never gives up!"""
    retry_count = 0
    backoff = 0.25
    
    # INFINITE RETRY LOOP
    while True:
        try:
            retry_count += 1
            _ws = await websockets.connect(uri)
            
            if retry_count > 1:
                logger.info(f"‚úÖ Reconnected after {retry_count} attempts")
            return _ws
            
        except Exception as e:
            # Log warning but NEVER give up
            if retry_count % 10 == 0:
                logger.warning(f"Still trying (attempt {retry_count})...")
            
            # Exponential backoff (cap at 5 seconds)
            await asyncio.sleep(backoff)
            backoff = min(5.0, backoff * 1.5)
            
            # CRITICAL: Continue loop - never raise exception!
            continue
```

**Key Differences:**
1. **No timeout** - infinite retry loop
2. **No exceptions** - never raises, just logs warnings
3. **Exponential backoff** - starts at 0.25s, caps at 5s
4. **Periodic logging** - every 10th retry to avoid spam
5. **Success logging** - reports reconnection after failures

---

### Deprecated Function: `_connection_health_monitor()`

**Location:** `scripts/run_ws_shim.py` (lines 93-116)

**Old Purpose:**
- Monitored connection health every 30 seconds
- Sent health pings to verify daemon was alive
- **Exited shim** after 3 consecutive failures (90 seconds)
- Relied on Augment to restart the shim

**Why It Failed:**
- Augment doesn't auto-restart MCP servers
- User had to manually toggle settings
- Defeated the purpose of auto-reconnection

**New Status:**
- Function kept for backward compatibility
- Does nothing - just sleeps forever
- All reconnection logic moved to `_ensure_ws()`

---

## üìä Behavior Comparison

### Scenario: Docker Container Restart

**OLD APPROACH:**
```
1. Docker stops
2. Shim detects failure (30s)
3. Health monitor counts failures (90s total)
4. Shim exits with sys.exit(0)
5. Augment... does nothing
6. User toggles Augment settings
7. Augment restarts shim
8. Connection restored
Total: 90s + manual intervention
```

**NEW APPROACH:**
```
1. Docker stops
2. Shim detects failure immediately
3. Shim retries connection (0.25s, 0.37s, 0.56s, 0.84s, 1.26s, 1.89s, 2.83s, 4.25s, 5s, 5s...)
4. Docker starts (let's say 10 seconds later)
5. Shim connects on next retry
6. Connection restored
Total: ~10-15s, zero manual intervention
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test 1: Normal Operation
**Steps:**
1. Start Docker daemon
2. Start Augment (shim connects)
3. Use EXAI tools
4. Verify everything works

**Expected:** ‚úÖ Normal operation

### Test 2: Docker Restart
**Steps:**
1. Use EXAI tool successfully
2. Restart Docker: `docker-compose restart`
3. Wait 10-15 seconds
4. Use EXAI tool again

**Expected:** ‚úÖ Tool works without manual intervention

**Logs to Check:**
```
[SHIM] Failed to connect: Connection refused. Retrying...
[SHIM] Still trying (attempt 10)...
[SHIM] ‚úÖ Reconnected after 12 attempts
```

### Test 3: Long Docker Downtime
**Steps:**
1. Stop Docker: `docker-compose stop`
2. Wait 5 minutes
3. Start Docker: `docker-compose start`
4. Use EXAI tool

**Expected:** ‚úÖ Tool works (shim kept retrying for 5 minutes)

**Logs to Check:**
```
[SHIM] Still trying (attempt 10)...
[SHIM] Still trying (attempt 20)...
[SHIM] Still trying (attempt 30)...
... (continues for 5 minutes)
[SHIM] ‚úÖ Reconnected after 62 attempts
```

## üîç Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Daemon Takes Long Time to Start
**Scenario:** Docker restart takes 60 seconds

**Behavior:**
- Shim retries every 5 seconds (after backoff caps)
- Logs every 10th attempt to avoid spam
- Connects as soon as daemon is ready
- No timeout, no failure

### 2. Network Issues
**Scenario:** Temporary network connectivity problems

**Behavior:**
- Shim treats it like any other connection failure
- Keeps retrying with exponential backoff
- Reconnects when network is restored

### 3. Daemon Crashes During Operation
**Scenario:** Daemon crashes while processing request

**Behavior:**
- Next tool call triggers `_ensure_ws()`
- Detects closed connection
- Enters retry loop
- Reconnects when daemon restarts

### 4. Multiple Rapid Restarts
**Scenario:** Docker restarted 3 times in 30 seconds

**Behavior:**
- Shim reconnects after each restart
- Logs show multiple reconnection events
- No manual intervention needed

---

## üìù Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Connection Settings:**
```bash
EXAI_WS_HOST=127.0.0.1
EXAI_WS_PORT=8079
EXAI_WS_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT=30  # Handshake timeout (not connection timeout)
```

**Removed Settings:**
```bash
# EXAI_WS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=30  # No longer used - infinite retry
```

**Health Check:**
```bash
EXAI_WS_SKIP_HEALTH_CHECK=false  # Optional pre-connection health check
```

### MCP Configuration

**File:** `Daemon/mcp-config.augmentcode.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "EXAI-WS": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "C:/Project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/.venv/Scripts/python.exe",
      "args": ["-u", "C:/Project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/scripts/run_ws_shim.py"],
      "env": {
        "EXAI_WS_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
        "EXAI_WS_PORT": "8079"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Point:** Command points to shim, which now never exits!

## üéØ Benefits

### 1. Zero Manual Intervention
- No need to toggle Augment settings
- No need to restart VS Code
- Works seamlessly in background

### 2. Faster Reconnection
- OLD: 90s + manual toggle
- NEW: 10-15s automatic

### 3. Simpler Architecture
- Removed health monitor exit logic
- Single reconnection mechanism
- Fewer moving parts

### 4. More Robust
- Handles any duration of downtime
- Handles multiple restarts
- Handles network issues

### 5. Better Logging
- Clear reconnection events
- Periodic status updates
- Success confirmation

## üö® Potential Issues

### Issue 1: Shim Process Never Dies
**Symptom:** Shim process keeps running even when not needed

**Mitigation:**
- Shim exits when Augment closes (stdio pipes break)
- Can manually kill if needed
- Not a real issue in practice

### Issue 2: Log Spam During Long Downtime
**Symptom:** Logs fill up with retry messages

**Mitigation:**
- Only log every 10th retry attempt
- Backoff caps at 5 seconds
- Reasonable log volume even after hours

### Issue 3: Connection Timeout on Long Operations
**Symptom:** Kimi requests taking 2+ minutes timeout on shim connection

**Status:** Separate issue - not related to reconnection
**Solution:** Increase `EXAI_WS_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT` or implement streaming
