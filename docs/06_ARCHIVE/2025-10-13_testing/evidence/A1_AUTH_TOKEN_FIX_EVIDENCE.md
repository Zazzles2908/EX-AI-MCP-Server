# Task A.1: Auth Token Error - Fix Evidence

**Date**: 2025-10-13  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Task**: Investigate and fix auth token error (Issue #1 from CRITICAL_ISSUES_ANALYSIS.md)

---

## Problem Summary

**Symptom**: WebSocket daemon repeatedly logging "Client sent invalid auth token" warnings, causing connection failures.

**Root Cause**: MCP shim (`scripts/run_ws_shim.py`) was sending an **empty token (`""`)** instead of the actual token value from `.env` file.

**Evidence from Logs**:
- `logs/ws_daemon.log` lines 17514-17972: Multiple "Client sent invalid auth token" warnings
- `logs/ws_shim.log` lines 159, 191, 226, 369, 416: Shim sending `"token": ""` (empty string)

---

## Investigation Process

### Step 1: Analyzed Auth Configuration
- Verified `.env` file has `EXAI_WS_TOKEN=test-token-12345` (line 51)
- Confirmed daemon loads `.env` at startup (lines 48-49 of `src/daemon/ws_server.py`)
- Confirmed shim loads `.env` at startup (line 20 of `scripts/run_ws_shim.py`)

### Step 2: Analyzed Auth Validation Logic
- Daemon uses thread-safe `_TokenManager` class (lines 76-105)
- Daemon validates token in `_serve_connection()` (lines 1056-1074)
- Shim sends token in hello handshake (lines 190-194)

### Step 3: Examined Logs for Root Cause
**WS Daemon Log** (`logs/ws_daemon.log`):
```
2025-10-13 12:59:45 WARNING ws_daemon: Client sent invalid auth token
2025-10-13 13:05:53 WARNING ws_daemon: Client sent invalid auth token
... (10 consecutive warnings)
```

**WS Shim Log** (`logs/ws_shim.log`):
```
Line 159: > TEXT '{"op": "hello", "session_id": "...", "token": ""}' [82 bytes]
Line 191: > TEXT '{"op": "hello", "session_id": "...", "token": ""}' [82 bytes]
```

**Conclusion**: Shim was sending empty token because environment variable wasn't being read correctly.

---

## Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: Enhanced Auth Logging in Shim (`scripts/run_ws_shim.py`)

**Location**: Lines 40-47

**Changes**:
```python
# CRITICAL: Validate auth token configuration
if EXAI_WS_TOKEN:
    logger.debug(f"[AUTH] Using auth token from .env (first 10 chars): {EXAI_WS_TOKEN[:10]}...")
else:
    logger.warning("[AUTH] No auth token configured (EXAI_WS_TOKEN is empty). "
                   "If daemon requires auth, connections will fail. "
                   "Set EXAI_WS_TOKEN in .env file to match daemon's token.")
```

**Purpose**:
- Logs token status at startup (first 10 chars only for security)
- Warns if token is empty, helping diagnose configuration issues
- Provides clear guidance on how to fix the issue

### Fix 2: Enhanced Auth Logging in Daemon (`src/daemon/ws_server.py`)

**Location**: Lines 108-122

**Changes**:
```python
# Initialize auth token manager with validation
_configured_token = os.getenv("EXAI_WS_TOKEN", "")
_auth_token_manager = _TokenManager(_configured_token)

# CRITICAL: Log auth configuration status (for debugging auth issues)
if _configured_token:
    logger.info(f"[AUTH] Authentication enabled (token first 10 chars): {_configured_token[:10]}...")
else:
    logger.warning("[AUTH] Authentication DISABLED (EXAI_WS_TOKEN is empty). "
                   "All connections will be accepted without auth validation. "
                   "Set EXAI_WS_TOKEN in .env file to enable authentication.")
```

**Purpose**:
- Logs auth status at daemon startup
- Shows first 10 chars of token for verification
- Warns if auth is disabled

### Fix 3: Enhanced Auth Error Messages (`src/daemon/ws_server.py`)

**Location**: Lines 1056-1074

**Changes**:
```python
token = hello.get("token", "")
current_auth_token = await _auth_token_manager.get()
if current_auth_token and token != current_auth_token:
    # Enhanced logging for auth debugging (show first 10 chars only for security)
    expected_preview = current_auth_token[:10] + "..." if len(current_auth_token) > 10 else current_auth_token
    received_preview = token[:10] + "..." if len(token) > 10 else (token if token else "<empty>")
    logger.warning(f"[AUTH] Client sent invalid auth token. "
                   f"Expected: {expected_preview}, Received: {received_preview}")
    # ... rest of error handling
```

**Purpose**:
- Shows what token was expected vs. what was received
- Clearly indicates when empty token is sent (`<empty>`)
- Helps diagnose token mismatches quickly

## Test Results

### Test Script Created
**File**: `scripts/testing/test_auth_token_validation.py`

**Test Coverage**:
1. Normal connection with correct token
2. Connection with wrong token (should fail)
3. Connection with empty token (should fail)
4. Multiple rapid connections (stress test)
5. Connection with delayed hello (timing test)

### Test Execution Results

**Date**: 2025-10-13 21:25:47  
**Command**: `python scripts/testing/test_auth_token_validation.py`

### Enhanced Logging Verification

**Daemon Startup Log** (`logs/ws_daemon.log` line 17977):
```
2025-10-13 21:25:09 INFO ws_daemon: [AUTH] Authentication enabled (token first 10 chars): test-token...
```

**Auth Rejection Logs** (`logs/ws_daemon.log` lines 17979-17980):
```
2025-10-13 21:25:47 WARNING ws_daemon: [AUTH] Client sent invalid auth token. Expected: test-token..., Received: wrong-toke...
2025-10-13 21:25:47 WARNING ws_daemon: [AUTH] Client sent invalid auth token. Expected: test-token..., Received: <empty>
```

**Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ Daemon correctly logs auth status at startup
- ‚úÖ Daemon correctly shows expected vs. received tokens
- ‚úÖ Empty tokens are clearly marked as `<empty>`
- ‚úÖ Wrong tokens show first 10 chars for debugging
