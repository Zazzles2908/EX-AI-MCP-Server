# K2 Models Schema Fix - 2025-10-14

## Executive Summary

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**  
**Impact:** Critical bug preventing K2 models from appearing in tool schemas  
**Root Cause:** Overly aggressive filter removing all models with `-preview` in the name  
**Solution:** Removed `-preview`, `-0711`, `-0905` from disallow_substrings filter  
**Verification:** Test passing - all 4 K2 models now appear in schema

---

## Problem Description

### User Report
> "The model in schema for some reason only shows currently 'auto', 'moonshot-v1-8k', 'moonshot-v1-32k', 'moonshot-v1-128k', 'kimi-latest', 'kimi-latest-8k', 'kimi-latest-32k', 'kimi-latest-128k', 'glm-4.6', 'glm-4.5-flash', 'glm-4.5', 'glm-4.5-air', 'glm-4.5v' But none of the k2 models."

### Missing K2 Models
- ❌ `kimi-k2-0905-preview` (user's preferred model)
- ❌ `kimi-k2-0711-preview`
- ❌ `kimi-k2-turbo-preview`
- ❌ `kimi-thinking-preview`

### Impact
- Users couldn't select K2 models from schema
- User preferences in .env were being ignored
- K2 models are superior to moonshot-v1 models (256K context, tool use, vision)
- User explicitly prefers K2 models over kimi-only models

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation
Located the bug in `tools/shared/base_tool_model_management.py` line 486:

```python
disallow_substrings = ["-250414", "-airx", "-preview", "-0711", "-0905"]
```

This filter was removing ALL models containing:
- `-preview` → Blocked all K2 preview models
- `-0711` → Blocked kimi-k2-0711-preview
- `-0905` → Blocked kimi-k2-0905-preview

### Why This Filter Existed
The filter was intended to remove internal/invalid model IDs like:
- `-250414` (internal version IDs)
- `-airx` (experimental variants)

But it was too aggressive and blocked legitimate K2 models.

---

## Solution

### Code Change
**File:** `tools/shared/base_tool_model_management.py`  
**Lines:** 483-516

**Before:**
```python
disallow_substrings = ["-250414", "-airx", "-preview", "-0711", "-0905"]
```

**After:**
```python
# REMOVED: "-preview", "-0711", "-0905" from disallow list
# These are valid K2 model names that user prefers (kimi-k2-0905-preview, etc.)
# Only filter out truly invalid/internal model IDs
disallow_substrings = ["-250414", "-airx"]
```

### Rationale
1. **K2 models are production-ready** - Not experimental despite "preview" suffix
2. **User preference** - User explicitly prefers K2 models
3. **Superior capabilities** - K2 models have better features than moonshot-v1
4. **Documented in config** - K2 models are in kimi_config.py as SUPPORTED_MODELS

---

## Verification

### Test: test_k2_models_in_schema.py

**Purpose:** Verify all K2 models appear in tool schema

**Method:**
1. Connect to WebSocket daemon
2. Request tool list
3. Extract model field schema from chat tool
4. Verify all 4 K2 models are present

**Results:**
```
✅ TEST PASSED: All K2 models found in description!

Model description:
Model to use. Native models: 'auto', 'kimi-k2-0905-preview', 'kimi-k2-0711-preview', 
'moonshot-v1-8k', 'moonshot-v1-32k', 'kimi-k2-turbo-preview', 'moonshot-v1-128k', 
'moonshot-v1-8k-vision-preview', 'moonshot-v1-32k-vision-preview', 
'moonshot-v1-128k-vision-preview', 'kimi-latest', 'kimi-latest-8k', 'kimi-latest-32k', 
'kimi-latest-128k', 'kimi-thinking-preview', 'glm-4.6', 'glm-4.5-flash', 'glm-4.5', 
'glm-4.5-air', 'glm-4.5v'. Use 'auto' to let the server select the best model.

✅ Found 4 K2 models in description:
  - kimi-k2-0905-preview
  - kimi-k2-0711-preview
  - kimi-k2-turbo-preview
  - kimi-thinking-preview
```

---

## Environment Configuration Verification

### .env File (Correct)
```bash
KIMI_DEFAULT_MODEL=kimi-k2-0905-preview  # ✅ K2 model
KIMI_THINKING_MODEL=kimi-thinking-preview  # ✅ K2 thinking model
KIMI_SPEED_MODEL=kimi-k2-turbo-preview  # ✅ K2 turbo model
KIMI_PREFERRED_MODELS=kimi-k2-0905-preview,kimi-k2-turbo-preview,kimi-k2-0711-preview  # ✅ K2 preference
```

### .env.example File (Updated)
Added missing preference lines to match .env:
```bash
KIMI_PREFERRED_MODELS=kimi-k2-0905-preview,kimi-k2-turbo-preview,kimi-k2-0711-preview
GLM_PREFERRED_MODELS=glm-4.5-flash,glm-4.6,glm-4.5,glm-4.5-air
```

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fix
- ❌ K2 models missing from schema
- ❌ User preferences ignored
- ❌ Inferior moonshot-v1 models shown instead
- ❌ No access to K2 features (256K context, vision, tool use)

### After Fix
- ✅ All 4 K2 models in schema
- ✅ User preferences respected
- ✅ Superior K2 models available
- ✅ Full access to K2 capabilities

### User Preference Alignment
User memory states:
> "User prefers kimi-k2-0905-preview as default Kimi model instead of kimi-latest for all documentation and code examples."

> "User prefers K2 models (kimi-k2-0905-preview, kimi-k2-turbo-preview, kimi-thinking-preview) over kimi-only models (moonshot-v1-*, kimi-latest-*)."

**Status:** ✅ Now fully aligned with user preferences
