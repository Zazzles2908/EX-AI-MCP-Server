## MODEL COMPARISON

- **Duration:** 31.6s
- **Model:** glm-4.5-flash (ZhipuAI provider)
- **Response Length:** ~1,375 tokens
- **Tool Events Captured:** NONE in metadata

### **Kimi-latest-128k (Run 2)**
- **Duration:** 54.9s (73% slower)
- **Model:** kimi-k2-0905-preview (Moonshot/Kimi provider)
- **Response Length:** ~1,209 tokens (13% shorter)
- **Tool Events Captured:** 1 event recorded
  ```json
  "tool_call_events":[{
    "provider":"kimi",
    "tool_name":"web_search",
    "args":{},
    "start_ts":1760050749.591226
  }]
  ```

## TRANSPARENCY ANALYSIS

### **What Kimi Revealed (GLM Hid):**

Kimi explicitly showed its search queries in the response:
```
<search>Australian coffee wholesalers online business suppliers 2024</search>
<search>best coffee bean suppliers Australia wholesale e-commerce dropshipping</search>
<search>Australian coffee roasters wholesale online business minimum order</search>
```

**Also showed:**
- `<search_quality_reflection>` - Internal reasoning about what data it needs
- `<search_quality_score>4</search_quality_score>` - Self-assessment of search strategy

GLM showed this instead:
```
<tool_call> (x48 instances - no detail)
```

**Critical Issue:** GLM made **48 tool calls** visible in output but **ZERO logged in metadata**. Kimi showed **3 search queries** in output but only **1 logged in metadata**.

---

## TOOL USAGE BREAKDOWN

### **GLM-4.5-flash:**
```
Visible: 48x <tool_call> tags (opaque)
Logged: 0 tool events in metadata
Actual behavior: Unknown - complete black box
```

### **Kimi-latest-128k:**
```
Visible: 3 search queries (transparent)
Logged: 1 web_search event
Actual behavior: web_search tool confirmed, but incomplete logging
```

**Hypothesis:** Your MCP server's event capture is **provider-dependent**. Kimi provider logs some events, GLM provider logs nothing.

## CONTENT QUALITY COMPARISON

| Dimension | GLM-4.5-flash | Kimi-latest-128k | Winner |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Supplier Focus** | Brand reputation (Campos, Market Lane, Single O) | Operations-first (Coffee Bean Shop, Zest, Grinders) | Kimi (more actionable) |
| **Concrete Data** | Vague ("minimum order quantities", "competitive pricing") | Specific ($18-22/kg, 5-15kg minimums, 24hr shipping) | **Kimi** |
| **E-commerce Integration** | "wholesale programs" (generic) | Dropshipping, white-label, inventory-free testing | **Kimi** |
| **Decision Framework** | By positioning (premium vs. bulk) | By business stage (startup → scaling → established) | **Kimi** |
| **Actionability** | "Contact suppliers directly" | "Start with Coffee Bean Shop, graduate to Zest/Di Bella" | **Kimi** |
| **Speed** | 31.6s | 54.9s | **GLM** |
| **Evidence Quality** | No pricing, no minimums, awards without dates | Specific minimums, pricing ranges, fulfillment times | **Kimi** |

## OPERATIONAL DYSFUNCTION DETECTED

### **1. Incomplete Telemetry**
Your MCP server's `tool_call_events` array is **critically underreporting**:
- Kimi: 3 visible searches → 1 logged event (66% loss)
- GLM: 48 visible tool calls → 0 logged events (100% loss)

**Impact:** You cannot audit agent behavior, token costs, or search query patterns.

### **2. Provider Inconsistency**
GLM wraps searches in `<tool_call>` tags (48 instances), Kimi uses `<search>` tags (3 instances). Your server doesn't normalize this.

**Impact:** Different models produce incompatible observability data.

### **3. No Token Attribution**
Neither response shows:
- Tokens per tool call
- Cumulative search tokens
- Model reasoning tokens vs. tool response tokens

**Impact:** Cannot optimize for cost/performance.

### **4. Opaque Search Results**
Neither response shows **what data the searches returned**. You see:
- Query sent
- Final synthesis
- ❌ Missing: Raw search results, source URLs, ranking logic

**Impact:** Cannot validate if agent hallucinated vs. misinterpreted search data.

---

## CRITICAL GAPS IN BOTH RESPONSES

**Neither agent provided:**
1. **Source URLs** - Where did "Coffee Bean Shop Australia" data come from?
2. **Verification timestamps** - Is "$18/kg" pricing current as of October 2025?
3. **Search result count** - How many suppliers were evaluated before selecting top 5?
4. **Confidence scores** - How certain is the agent about each claim?
5. **Contradictory data handling** - If two sources gave different minimums, which was chosen and why?

**Both agents claimed specific data without provenance:**
- Kimi: "$18/kg, 5kg minimums, 24hr shipping" ← No citation
- GLM: "Established 2002, direct trade relationships" ← No citation

## RECOMMENDED AUDIT ACTIONS

### **Immediate (Next 2 hours):**
1. **Check your MCP server logs** - Search for "tool_call" or "web_search" in raw logs
2. **Verify tool registration** - Confirm GLM provider actually registers tool events
3. **Test other models** - Run same query with `glm-4.6` and `moonshot-v1-128k` to map event capture patterns

### **This Week:**
4. **Add response parsing** - Extract `<search>` and `<tool_call>` tags from content, cross-reference with metadata
5. **Implement source tracking** - Modify server to capture search result URLs before synthesis
6. **Token metering** - Add per-tool-call token counters (if provider APIs expose this)

### **This Month:**
7. **Hallucination detection** - Compare agent claims against raw search results to measure accuracy
8. **Build observability dashboard** - Visualize: queries/min, tokens/query, accuracy scores, provider reliability

## YOUR AGENT'S ACTUAL TOOL CHAIN (RECONSTRUCTED)

Based on visible output patterns:

```
User Query
    ↓
MCP Server (exai-mcp:chat)
    ↓
Provider API Call (GLM or Kimi)
    ↓
Model decides: "Need web data"
    ↓
[BLACK BOX - Not captured by your server]
    ↓
Provider's internal web_search tool
    ↓
Search API (Unknown - Brave? Google? Provider-specific?)
    ↓
Results returned to model
    ↓
Model synthesizes response
    ↓
Response sent to your MCP server
    ↓
Partial metadata captured (inconsistent)
    ↓
Returned to you
```

**Problem:** Steps marked [BLACK BOX] are invisible to you. You're trusting provider telemetry that isn't comprehensive.

## COMPARISON VERDICT

**Kimi-latest-128k wins on:**
- Operational specificity (pricing, minimums, timelines)
- E-commerce integration focus (dropshipping, white-label)
- Transparent reasoning (showed search queries)
- Actionable next steps (staged supplier adoption)

**GLM-4.5-flash wins on:**
- Speed (42% faster)
- Brand quality focus (more recognizable suppliers)

**Both fail on:**
- Source attribution (zero citations)
- Data freshness verification
- Search result transparency
- Complete observability

**Next Test:** Want me to call the same query with `thinking_mode="max"` to see if deeper reasoning improves output quality? Or test a model that might have better telemetry (moonshot-v1-128k)?
