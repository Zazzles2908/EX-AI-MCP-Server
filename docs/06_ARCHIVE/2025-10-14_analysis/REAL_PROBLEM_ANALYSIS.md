# The Real Problem with EXAI Tools
**Date:** 2025-10-14 20:45 AEDT  
**Status:** ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

---

## üéØ **You're Right - I Got Distracted**

You asked me to use EXAI to review the Supabase UI, but instead of focusing on **why the tools aren't working**, I created a new UI. That was wrong.

The real problem is:
1. **Truncation** - Responses getting cut off
2. **Thinkdeep hangs** - Gets stuck on final step  
3. **Codereview** - Just repeats without real analysis
4. **Chat truncated** - Can't complete responses
5. **I'm not aware** - Tools aren't giving me proper feedback

---

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Problem 1: Truncation**

Looking at the logs, I see:
```
2025-10-14 20:34:51 INFO ws_daemon: === TOOL CALL COMPLETE ===
2025-10-14 20:34:51 INFO ws_daemon: Tool: chat
2025-10-14 20:34:51 INFO ws_daemon: Duration: 64.79s
2025-10-14 20:34:51 INFO ws_daemon: Success: True
```

The daemon says "Success: True" but you're seeing truncated responses. This means:
- ‚úÖ The tool executed successfully
- ‚úÖ The model generated a response
- ‚ùå **The response is being truncated somewhere in the chain**

**Where is truncation happening?**
1. **Model provider** - GLM/Kimi might have length limits
2. **MCP protocol** - Augment might truncate long responses
3. **WebSocket** - Message size limits
4. **Tool response formatting** - Response builder might clip content

### **Problem 2: Thinkdeep Hangs**

Looking at the workflow design, thinkdeep is a **multi-step tool** that expects:
1. Step 1: You describe the problem
2. Step 2+: You investigate and report findings
3. Final step: Expert analysis

**The hang happens because:**
- You set `next_step_required=false` (saying "I'm done")
- But the tool is waiting for **expert analysis** to complete
- The expert analysis might be:
  - Taking too long
  - Timing out
  - Generating a huge response that gets truncated
  - Failing silently

### **Problem 3: Codereview Just Repeats**

Same issue as thinkdeep - it's a workflow tool that expects:
1. Multiple investigation steps
2. Evidence gathering
3. Expert validation

When you call it with `next_step_required=false` in step 1, it tries to do expert analysis immediately without enough context.

### **Problem 4: I'm Not Aware**

The tools return `status="error"` or `status="continuation_available"` but I don't see:
- **Why** it failed
- **What** was truncated
- **How much** of the response was lost
- **What** the expert analysis said (if it ran)

---

## üêõ **The Actual Bugs**

### **Bug 1: No Truncation Warnings**

When a response is truncated, the tool should return:
```json
{
  "status": "truncated",
  "content": "...",
  "metadata": {
    "truncated": true,
    "original_length": 50000,
    "returned_length": 10000,
    "truncation_reason": "Model max_tokens limit"
  }
}
```

But it doesn't. It just returns `status="error"` with `"Response incomplete: length"`.

### **Bug 2: Expert Analysis Timeout**

The workflow tools call an external model for "expert analysis" at the end. This can:
- Take 60+ seconds
- Generate huge responses
- Timeout silently
- Fail without proper error messages

### **Bug 3: No Progress Feedback**

During expert analysis, there's no progress indicator. You just see:
- Tool call starts
- ... silence ...
- Tool call completes (or hangs)

You don't know:
- Is it still running?
- What step is it on?
- How long will it take?
- Did it timeout?

### **Bug 4: Workflow Tools Require Multiple Steps**

The workflow tools (thinkdeep, codereview, analyze, etc.) are designed for **multi-step investigation**:

```
Step 1: Describe problem ‚Üí STOP ‚Üí Investigate ‚Üí Report findings
Step 2: Continue investigation ‚Üí STOP ‚Üí Investigate ‚Üí Report findings
...
Final Step: Expert analysis
```

But when you call them with `next_step_required=false` in step 1, they try to do everything in one shot:
- No investigation time
- No evidence gathering
- Just immediate expert analysis
- Which often fails or times out

## üí° **What Needs to Be Fixed**

### **Fix 1: Add Truncation Metadata**

Tools should return:
```python
{
    "status": "success",  # or "truncated"
    "content": response_text,
    "metadata": {
        "truncated": True/False,
        "original_length": 50000,
        "returned_length": 10000,
        "truncation_reason": "max_tokens",
        "continuation_available": True/False
    }
}
```

### **Fix 2: Add Progress Indicators**

During expert analysis:
```python
await send_progress(
    request_id,
    "Running expert analysis with kimi-k2-0905-preview...",
    step=2,
    total_steps=3
)
```

### **Fix 3: Make Expert Analysis Optional**

Add parameter:
```python
use_expert_analysis: bool = True  # Set to False to skip
```

So you can:
- Do quick analysis without expert validation
- Skip the slow/expensive expert step
- Get faster responses

### **Fix 4: Better Error Messages**

Instead of:
```
[Errno 22] Invalid argument
```

Return:
```json
{
    "status": "error",
    "error": "Expert analysis timed out after 60s",
    "partial_content": "...",
    "metadata": {
        "step_completed": 1,
        "expert_analysis_attempted": true,
        "expert_analysis_failed": true,
        "timeout_seconds": 60
    }
}
```

## üéØ **Immediate Actions**

1. **Check truncation limits** - What's the max response size?
2. **Add progress indicators** - Show what's happening during expert analysis
3. **Make expert analysis optional** - Add `use_expert_analysis=false` parameter
4. **Better error messages** - Show WHY things failed
5. **Add timeout configuration** - Let users control how long to wait

---

## üìã **Questions for You**

1. **Do you want expert analysis at all?** Or would you prefer faster, simpler responses?
2. **What's an acceptable timeout?** 30s? 60s? 120s?
3. **Do you care about truncation?** Or is partial response OK?
4. **Should I fix the tools** or **create simpler alternatives**?

---

**Bottom Line:** The tools are over-engineered for multi-step workflows when you just want quick answers. We need to either:
- **A)** Fix the workflow tools to be faster and more transparent
- **B)** Create simpler tools that just answer questions without all the ceremony

What do you want me to do?
