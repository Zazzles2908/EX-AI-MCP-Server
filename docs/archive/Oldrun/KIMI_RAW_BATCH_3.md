## Findings

### CRITICAL: Missing GLM-4.6 model configuration
**File:** glm_config.py
**Lines:** 15-50
**Category:** architecture
**Issue:** The SUPPORTED_MODELS dictionary only includes GLM-4.5 models but not the flagship GLM-4.6 model with 200K context window that the system documentation emphasizes as the primary model. This is a major architecture mismatch with the system design.
**Recommendation:** Add GLM-4.6 model configuration with 200K context window, $0.60/$2.20 pricing, and proper capabilities flags as documented in 01-system-overview.md and 07-upgrade-roadmap.md.

### HIGH: Incomplete streaming implementation
**File:** glm_chat.py
**Lines:** 120-180
**Category:** architecture
**Issue:** The streaming implementation lacks proper error handling for network interruptions and doesn't implement the retry/backoff mechanism described in the hybrid_platform_manager.py. The SSE parsing is fragile and may fail on malformed chunks.
**Recommendation:** Implement robust error handling with exponential backoff, connection recovery, and better SSE parsing that handles edge cases like partial JSON or malformed chunks.

### HIGH: Missing zai-sdk integration
**File:** glm.py
**Lines:** 35-45
**Category:** architecture
**Issue:** The code imports zhipuai SDK but the system documentation specifically mentions using zai-sdk v0.0.4 for international users accessing api.z.ai. This is importing the wrong SDK for the target audience.
**Recommendation:** Import and use zai-sdk instead of zhipuai SDK, or implement dual SDK support with proper fallback as described in the system architecture.

### MEDIUM: Inconsistent error handling patterns
**File:** glm_files.py
**Lines:** 80-95
**Category:** code_quality
**Issue:** The file upload function catches exceptions but only logs at warning level and continues with HTTP fallback. This could mask important SDK issues and make debugging difficult.
**Recommendation:** Implement structured error handling with specific exception types, proper logging with context, and consider whether fallback is always appropriate vs. failing fast.

### MEDIUM: Missing type hints and documentation
**File:** hybrid_platform_manager.py
**Lines:** 15-30
**Category:** code_quality
**Issue:** The __init__ method lacks proper type hints for optional parameters and doesn't document the expected environment variable names clearly.
**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive type hints, docstring documentation, and consider using Pydantic for configuration validation.

### LOW: Unused imports and dead code
**File:** glm.py
**Lines:** 1-15
**Category:** dead_code
**Issue:** Several imports are unused (logging, os) and the HttpClient import appears to be used but not properly integrated with the error handling patterns.
**Recommendation:** Clean up unused imports and ensure consistent use of imported modules throughout the codebase.

### LOW: Magic numbers without constants
**File:** glm_config.py
**Lines:** 60-80
**Category:** maintainability
**Issue:** Token counting uses magic numbers (0.6, 0.25, 0.2) without named constants or clear documentation of their origin.
**Recommendation:** Define named constants for token ratios and add documentation explaining the heuristics used.

## Good Patterns

### Dual SDK/HTTP fallback pattern
**File:** glm.py
**Reason:** The implementation correctly follows the system architecture pattern of preferring SDK with HTTP fallback, which provides resilience and compatibility as described in 02-provider-architecture.md.

### Environment-gated streaming
**File:** glm_chat.py
**Lines:** 85-95
**Reason:** Properly implements the environment-gated streaming feature described in 04-features-and-capabilities.md, allowing streaming to be disabled via GLM_STREAM_ENABLED environment variable.

### Language-aware token counting
**File:** glm_config.py
**Lines:** 60-85
**Reason:** Implements sophisticated language-aware token counting that handles CJK characters differently from ASCII, which is appropriate for GLM's Chinese language capabilities.

### Comprehensive file upload with size validation
**File:** glm_files.py
**Lines:** 40-60
**Reason:** Implements proper file existence checks, size validation, MIME type detection, and configurable timeouts for file uploads, following security best practices.

## Summary
- Total issues: 7
- Critical: 1
- High: 2
- Medium: 2
- Low: 2
- Overall quality: needs_improvement

The code shows good architectural patterns but has critical gaps in model configuration and SDK integration that don't align with the documented system design. The missing GLM-4.6 model configuration is particularly concerning as it's the flagship model emphasized throughout the documentation.
