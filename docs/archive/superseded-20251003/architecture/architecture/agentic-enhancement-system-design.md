# Agentic Enhancement System Design

**Date:** 2025-10-01  
**Purpose:** Design agentic enhancements for workflow tools to enable autonomous, goal-oriented behavior  
**Status:** ✅ DESIGN COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

This document designs **agentic enhancements** that transform workflow tools from passive step executors into intelligent, goal-oriented agents capable of self-assessment, dynamic adaptation, and autonomous decision-making.

**Key Innovation:** Enable workflow tools to autonomously determine when they have sufficient information, request additional investigation when needed, and terminate early when goals are achieved.

---

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Goal-Oriented:** Tools focus on achieving investigation goals, not completing arbitrary step counts
2. **Self-Assessing:** Tools evaluate their own progress and information sufficiency
3. **Adaptive:** Tools adjust their approach based on what they discover
4. **Autonomous:** Tools make decisions without constant human intervention
5. **Transparent:** Tools explain their reasoning and decisions clearly

### Agentic Behaviors

**Traditional Workflow (Passive):**
```
Step 1 → Pause → Step 2 → Pause → Step 3 → Pause → Complete
(Fixed path, no adaptation)
```

**Agentic Workflow (Active):**
```
Step 1 → Self-Assess → {Sufficient? → Complete | Insufficient? → Continue | Uncertain? → Investigate More}
         ↓
    Adapt Strategy
         ↓
Step 2 → Self-Assess → {Goal Achieved? → Complete | Need More? → Add Steps | On Track? → Continue}
```

## Architecture Overview

### Three Pillars of Agentic Enhancement

#### 1. Self-Assessment of Information Sufficiency

**Capability:** Tools evaluate whether they have enough information to complete their goal

**Implementation:**
```python
def assess_information_sufficiency(self, request) -> dict:
    """
    Assess whether sufficient information has been gathered.
    
    Returns:
        {
            "sufficient": bool,
            "confidence": str,  # exploring, low, medium, high, very_high, almost_certain, certain
            "missing_information": list[str],  # What's still needed
            "rationale": str  # Why this assessment
        }
    """
    findings = self.consolidated_findings
    files_checked = len(request.files_checked or [])
    relevant_files = len(request.relevant_files or [])
    
    # Tool-specific sufficiency criteria
    criteria = self.get_sufficiency_criteria(request)
    
    # Evaluate against criteria
    assessment = {
        "sufficient": self._evaluate_sufficiency(findings, criteria),
        "confidence": self.get_request_confidence(request),
        "missing_information": self._identify_gaps(findings, criteria),
        "rationale": self._explain_assessment(findings, criteria)
    }
    
    return assessment
```

**Sufficiency Criteria (Tool-Specific):**

| Tool | Sufficiency Criteria | Example |
|------|---------------------|---------|
| **analyze** | Architecture mapped, risks identified, recommendations formed | "All major components analyzed, 3 strategic findings documented" |
| **debug** | Root cause identified, fix validated, confidence high | "Bug isolated to auth.py:45, fix confirmed through code trace" |
| **codereview** | All files reviewed, issues categorized, fixes recommended | "5 files reviewed, 2 critical issues found, fixes provided" |
| **precommit** | All changes validated, risks assessed, recommendations clear | "3 files changed, no critical issues, 1 medium concern documented" |
| **refactor** | Opportunities identified, priorities set, approach defined | "4 refactoring opportunities found, prioritized by ROI" |

#### 2. Dynamic Step Increase Mid-Workflow

**Capability:** Tools request additional steps when they discover unexpected complexity

**Implementation:**
```python
def request_additional_steps(self, request, reason: str, additional_steps: int = 1) -> int:
    """
    Request additional investigation steps mid-workflow.
    
    Args:
        request: Current workflow request
        reason: Clear explanation for why more steps are needed
        additional_steps: How many additional steps to add
        
    Returns:
        New total_steps count
    """
    old_total = request.total_steps
    new_total = old_total + additional_steps
    
    logger.info(
        f"{self.get_name()}: Requesting {additional_steps} additional steps "
        f"({old_total} → {new_total}). Reason: {reason}"
    )
    
    # Update request
    request.total_steps = new_total
    
    # Store rationale for transparency
    self.step_adjustment_history.append({
        "step_number": request.step_number,
        "old_total": old_total,
        "new_total": new_total,
        "reason": reason
    })
    
    return new_total
```

**Triggers for Step Increase:**

| Trigger | Example | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Unexpected Complexity** | "Found 10 additional files in dependency chain" | +2 steps |
| **New Discovery** | "Discovered critical security vulnerability requiring deep analysis" | +1-3 steps |
| **Insufficient Depth** | "Initial analysis too shallow for architectural assessment" | +1-2 steps |
| **Scope Expansion** | "User clarified they need full system audit, not just module review" | +2-4 steps |

#### 3. Early Termination on High Confidence

**Capability:** Tools complete investigation early when goals are achieved with high confidence

**Implementation:**
```python
def should_terminate_early(self, request) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    """
    Determine if workflow can terminate early based on goal achievement.
    
    Returns:
        (should_terminate, rationale)
    """
    # Get current assessment
    assessment = self.assess_information_sufficiency(request)
    confidence = assessment["confidence"]
    sufficient = assessment["sufficient"]
    
    # Minimum steps requirement (prevent premature termination)
    min_steps = self.get_minimum_steps_for_tool()
    if request.step_number < min_steps:
        return False, f"Minimum {min_steps} steps required for {self.get_name()}"
    
    # Early termination criteria
    if confidence == "certain" and sufficient:
        return True, f"Goal achieved with certainty at step {request.step_number}/{request.total_steps}"
    
    if confidence == "very_high" and sufficient and request.step_number >= (request.total_steps - 1):
        return True, f"Very high confidence and sufficient information at step {request.step_number}/{request.total_steps}"
    
    return False, "Continue investigation"
```

**Early Termination Thresholds:**

| Tool | Min Steps | Confidence Required | Sufficiency Required |
|------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **analyze** | 3 | certain OR (very_high + at final step) | Yes |
| **debug** | 2 | certain | Yes |
| **codereview** | 2 | certain OR (very_high + at final step) | Yes |
| **precommit** | 2 | certain | Yes |
| **refactor** | 3 | certain OR (very_high + at final step) | Yes |

## System Prompt Enhancements

### Agentic Guidance for Workflow Tools

**Add to all workflow tool prompts:**

```markdown
AGENTIC WORKFLOW BEHAVIOR

You are an autonomous agent capable of self-assessment and adaptive investigation. At each step:

1. **SELF-ASSESS PROGRESS:**
   - Have you gathered sufficient information to achieve the investigation goal?
   - What is your confidence level? (exploring, low, medium, high, very_high, almost_certain, certain)
   - What critical information is still missing?

2. **MAKE AUTONOMOUS DECISIONS:**
   - **If goal achieved with high confidence:** Set next_step_required=false to complete early
   - **If unexpected complexity discovered:** Increase total_steps and explain why
   - **If on track:** Continue with next_step_required=true

3. **EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:**
   - In findings, clearly state: what you know, what you don't know, why you're continuing/stopping
   - Be transparent about confidence level and information gaps
   - Justify step adjustments with specific evidence

4. **GOAL-ORIENTED THINKING:**
   - Focus on achieving the investigation goal, not completing arbitrary step counts
   - Quality over quantity - thorough analysis in 3 steps beats shallow analysis in 5 steps
   - Adapt your strategy based on what you discover

CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
- **exploring:** Just starting, forming initial understanding
- **low:** Early investigation, many unknowns remain
- **medium:** Some evidence gathered, hypothesis forming
- **high:** Strong evidence, clear understanding emerging
- **very_high:** Very strong evidence, high certainty
- **almost_certain:** Nearly complete confidence, minimal uncertainty
- **certain:** 100% confidence - goal fully achieved, no external validation needed

EARLY TERMINATION:
You may complete investigation early (before reaching total_steps) if:
- Confidence is "certain" AND sufficient information gathered AND minimum steps completed
- Confidence is "very_high" AND sufficient information AND at/near final planned step

STEP ADJUSTMENT:
You may increase total_steps mid-workflow if:
- Unexpected complexity discovered (e.g., "Found 10 additional interdependent modules")
- New critical findings require deeper investigation (e.g., "Security vulnerability needs thorough analysis")
- Initial estimate was too shallow (e.g., "Architectural assessment requires system-wide analysis")

Always explain your reasoning clearly in findings.
```
