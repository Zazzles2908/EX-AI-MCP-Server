# Wave 2 - Architecture Cleanup Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-03  
**Epic:** 2.2 - Web Search Prompt Injection Fix (Architecture Investigation)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## üéØ Objectives

1. Remove dead code (tools/unified/ directory)
2. Investigate blocking scripts preventing full system capabilities
3. Update .env files with comprehensive documentation
4. Enable full system access during development stage

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Actions

### 1. Dead Code Removal

**Removed:** `tools/unified/` directory (4 files)
- `framework.py` (34 lines) - Experimental BaseUnifiedTool class
- `chaining.py` - Unused chaining utilities
- `param_suggestion.py` - Unused parameter suggestion
- `perf.py` - Unused performance utilities

**Evidence:**
- NOT documented in any `docs/` files
- NOT imported by any active code
- NOT registered in `tools/registry.py`
- Zero production usage

**Impact:** ‚úÖ No breaking changes - dead code only

---

### 2. Tool Visibility Unblocking

**File:** `tools/registry.py`  
**Change:** Updated TOOL_VISIBILITY map to enable full development access

**Before (9 tools marked "hidden"):**
```python
"provider_capabilities": "hidden",  # AI-manager-only diagnostics
"listmodels": "hidden",              # AI-manager-only diagnostics
"version": "hidden",                 # AI-manager-only diagnostics
"kimi_upload_and_extract": "hidden", # backend pathway only
"kimi_capture_headers": "hidden",    # diagnostics-only
"glm_upload_file": "hidden",         # backend pathway only
"glm_payload_preview": "hidden",     # diagnostics-only
"toolcall_log_tail": "hidden",
"health": "hidden",
```

**After (All tools "advanced" for development):**
```python
"provider_capabilities": "advanced",  # Diagnostics - useful during development
"listmodels": "advanced",              # Diagnostics - useful during development
"version": "advanced",                 # Diagnostics - useful during development
"kimi_upload_and_extract": "advanced", # Backend pathway - useful during development
"kimi_capture_headers": "advanced",    # Diagnostics - useful during development
"glm_upload_file": "advanced",         # Backend pathway - useful during development
"glm_payload_preview": "advanced",     # Diagnostics - useful during development
"toolcall_log_tail": "advanced",       # Diagnostics - useful during development
"health": "advanced",                  # Diagnostics - useful during development
```

**Added Note:**
```python
# NOTE: During development, all tools are set to 'core' or 'advanced' for full accessibility.
# In production, consider setting diagnostic tools to 'hidden' to reduce MCP client clutter.
```

**Impact:** ‚úÖ All 9 diagnostic/development tools now accessible to MCP clients

### 3. Environment File Documentation

**File:** `.env.example`  
**Change:** Added comprehensive documentation for all restriction variables

**Added Sections:**

#### Client-Specific Configuration
- CLIENT_TOOL_ALLOWLIST - Tool filtering (with WARNING about restrictions)
- CLIENT_TOOL_DENYLIST - Tool blocking (with WARNING about restrictions)
- CLIENT_DEFAULTS_USE_WEBSEARCH - Web search defaults
- CLIENT_DEFAULT_THINKING_MODE - Thinking depth defaults
- CLIENT_MAX_WORKFLOW_STEPS - Workflow step limits (with WARNING about restrictions)

#### Provider Gating
- DISABLED_PROVIDERS - Provider disabling (with WARNING about restrictions)
- ALLOWED_PROVIDERS - Provider allowlist (with WARNING about restrictions)
- Note about intentional GOOGLE/OPENAI/XAI/DIAL disabling

#### Tool Gating
- DISABLED_TOOLS - Tool disabling (with WARNING about restrictions)
- Reference to TOOL_VISIBILITY in tools/registry.py

#### Feature Flags
- ROUTER_ENABLED - Intelligent routing
- ENABLE_INTELLIGENT_ROUTING - AI manager routing
- GLM_STREAM_ENABLED - GLM streaming
- KIMI_STREAM_ENABLED - Kimi streaming
- GLM_ENABLE_WEB_BROWSING - GLM web search
- KIMI_ENABLE_INTERNET_SEARCH - Kimi web search
- EX_WEB_ENABLED - Web search backend

**Key Addition:**
```bash
# IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOPMENT: Leave these variables unset/empty to enable FULL system capabilities.
# Setting CLIENT_TOOL_ALLOWLIST or CLIENT_TOOL_DENYLIST RESTRICTS tool visibility.
# Setting CLIENT_MAX_WORKFLOW_STEPS LIMITS workflow tool functionality.
```

**Impact:** ‚úÖ Clear documentation prevents accidental restrictions

---

### 4. .env File Status

**File:** `.env`  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Already configured for full system access

**Verified Settings:**
- ‚úÖ ROUTER_ENABLED=true
- ‚úÖ GLM_STREAM_ENABLED=true
- ‚úÖ GLM_ENABLE_WEB_BROWSING=true
- ‚úÖ KIMI_STREAM_ENABLED=true
- ‚úÖ ENABLE_INTELLIGENT_ROUTING=true
- ‚úÖ EX_WEB_ENABLED=true
- ‚úÖ KIMI_ENABLE_INTERNET_SEARCH=true
- ‚úÖ No CLIENT_TOOL_ALLOWLIST/DENYLIST set (unrestricted)
- ‚úÖ No DISABLED_PROVIDERS set (all enabled)
- ‚úÖ No DISABLED_TOOLS set (all enabled)

**Impact:** ‚úÖ No changes needed - already optimal for development

---

## üîç Investigation Findings

### No Blocking Scripts Found

**Investigated Areas:**
1. ‚úÖ Tool Visibility - Fixed (9 tools changed from "hidden" to "advanced")
2. ‚úÖ Provider Restrictions - None found (intentional GLM/Kimi-only deployment)
3. ‚úÖ Feature Flags - All enabled in .env
4. ‚úÖ Routing Logic - Properly enabled
5. ‚úÖ Web Search Integration - Fully configured

**Conclusion:** The only blocking issue was TOOL_VISIBILITY settings. All other systems are properly configured for full capabilities.

## üìä Architecture Validation

### Confirmed Current Design

**tools/simple/base.py (1,184 lines)** - ‚úÖ PRODUCTION CODE
- Status: Active, documented, current design
- Used by: chat.py and other simple tools
- Pattern: Template Method for request/response tools

**tools/workflow/base.py (571 lines)** - ‚úÖ PRODUCTION CODE
- Status: Active, documented, current design
- Used by: All workflow tools (analyze, debug, codereview, etc.)
- Pattern: Template Method + State Machine

**tools/workflows/** - ‚úÖ PRODUCTION CODE
- Status: Individual tool implementations
- Imports from: tools/workflow/base.py
- Pattern: Intentional separation (base vs implementations)

**tools/unified/** - ‚ùå DEAD CODE (REMOVED)
- Status: Experimental, unused, not documented
- Impact: Zero production usage

### No Duplication Found

**tools/workflow/** vs **tools/workflows/** is intentional separation:
- `tools/workflow/` - Base classes and mixins
- `tools/workflows/` - Individual tool implementations
- This is correct design, NOT duplication

## üéØ Impact Summary

| Category | Before | After | Impact |

| **Hidden Tools** | 9 tools | 0 tools | ‚úÖ Full access |
| **Documentation** | Minimal | Comprehensive | ‚úÖ Clarity |
| **Restrictions** | Unclear | Clearly documented | ‚úÖ Transparency |
