## 1. Codebase Integration Points

### EXAI Tool Integration Architecture

**Entry Point:**
- `src/daemon/ws_server.py` - WebSocket daemon on ws://127.0.0.1:8765
- Tool name normalization: `_normalize_tool_name()` strips "_EXAI-WS" suffixes
- Handles: chat_EXAI-WS, thinkdeep_EXAI-WS, analyze_EXAI-WS, etc.

**Request Dispatcher:**
- `src/server/handlers/request_handler.py` - Main tool execution dispatcher
- Routes tool calls to appropriate handlers
- Manages conversation context (continuation_id)
- Handles model selection and provider routing

**Tool Registry:**
- `server.py` - TOOLS dict (lines 271-289)
- Centralized tool registration
- Extensible architecture for new tools

**Routing:**
- `src/router/unified_router.py` - Delegates to canonical handlers
- Maintains parity between stdio MCP and WS daemon

### Provider Integration Points

**GLM Provider:**
- `src/providers/glm_chat.py` - SDK integration for GLM models
- **Dual SDK/HTTP Pattern:** Lines 52-61, 107, 116
- Handles streaming, tool calling, web search
- **Critical for Wave 3:** SDK upgrade integration point

**Kimi Provider:**
- `src/providers/kimi_chat.py` - API integration for Kimi models
- Handles file upload, multi-file chat, caching
- Agentic intelligence, tool use, coding

**Provider Registry:**
- `src/providers/registry.py` - Provider selection logic
- Model-to-provider mapping
- Capability-based routing

### Critical Files for Wave 2-3

## 2. Optimal Epic Sequencing (Leverage-First Strategy)

### Wave 2 Implementation Sequence

**Phase 1: Epic 2.2 - Web Search Prompt Injection Fix** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Why First:**
- **Highest Impact on Project Goal:** Directly addresses "seamless assistant" requirement
- **Unblocks Testing:** Enables better testing of all other features
- **User Experience:** Eliminates manual intervention requirement
- **Leverage Effect:** Improves all subsequent development and testing

**Issue:**
- chat_EXAI-WS responds with 'SEARCH REQUIRED: Please immediately perform...' instead of autonomously executing searches
- Breaks "seamless assistant" goal - requires manual intervention

**Integration Point:**
- `src/server/handlers/request_handler.py` (tool execution logic)
- Modify tool execution flow to auto-execute web searches

**Complexity:** MEDIUM (requires modifying tool execution flow)

**Alignment:** CRITICAL - directly addresses "intelligently handling any prompt"

---

**Phase 2: Epic 2.3 - EXAI Tool UX Improvements** (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Why Second:**
- **Builds on Working Web Search:** Requires functional web search for testing
- **Improves User Experience:** Enhances "effective assistant" goal
- **Non-Blocking:** Doesn't prevent other work from proceeding

**Issues:**
- continuation_id messaging rigidity (assumes Claude is user)
- Path validation UX issues (rejects relative paths with unclear errors)
- Tool rigidity patterns (fixed vs flexible for real-world usage)

**Integration Points:**
- Tool parameter validation logic
- Error message generation
- User-facing messaging

**Complexity:** LOW-MEDIUM (mostly messaging and validation logic)

**Alignment:** HIGH - improves "effective assistant" experience

---

**Phase 3: Epic 2.4 - Diagnostic Tools & Logging** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Why Third:**
- **Supports Development:** Improves troubleshooting but doesn't affect core functionality
- **Additive:** No breaking changes, low risk
- **Benefits All Subsequent Work:** Helps with Wave 3 debugging

**Purpose:**
- Debugging support for EXAI tool issues
- Comprehensive logging for tool usage patterns
- Progress indicators for long-running operations

**Integration Points:**
- Logging infrastructure
- Monitoring systems
- Progress tracking

**Complexity:** LOW (additive, no breaking changes)

**Alignment:** MEDIUM - supports development but not end-user experience

---

**Phase 4: Epic 2.5 - Wave 2 Validation & Testing** (DECISION GATE)

**Purpose:**
- Comprehensive testing of all Wave 2 improvements
- Validate web search fix works correctly
- Ensure no regressions in existing functionality
- **Decision:** Proceed to Wave 3?

**Success Criteria:**
- Web search works autonomously (no 'SEARCH REQUIRED' messages)
- UX improvements tested and validated
- Diagnostic tools functional
- No regressions in existing functionality
- All tests passing

## 4. Wave 3 Preparation (Start NOW)

### Critical Path Analysis

**Wave 3 Structure:**
- **6 Sequential Epics** (longest chain in project)
- **NO Parallelization** possible (each epic blocks the next)
- **Highest Risk** area in entire project
- **Foundation** for all new features (Wave 4)

### Epic-by-Epic Risk Assessment

**Epic 3.1: Test Environment Setup** (MEDIUM RISK)
- Create venv-test-v004, install zai-sdk v0.0.4
- **Risk:** Dependency conflicts, version incompatibilities
- **Mitigation:** Isolated environment, comprehensive testing

**Epic 3.2: Dependency Management** (HIGH RISK)
- Update requirements.txt to zai-sdk>=0.0.4
- **Risk:** Breaking changes despite analysis (unknown unknowns)
- **Mitigation:** Rollback plan, incremental validation

**Epic 3.3: Provider Code Updates** (HIGHEST RISK)
- Modify src/providers/glm_chat.py for zai-sdk v0.0.4
- **Risk:** Breaking dual SDK/HTTP pattern, streaming issues
- **Mitigation:** Maintain existing pattern, comprehensive testing

**Epic 3.4: GLM-4.6 Integration** (MEDIUM RISK)
- Update model references, configure 200K context
- **Risk:** Context window issues, pricing misconfiguration
- **Mitigation:** Incremental testing, validation checkpoints

**Epic 3.5: Backward Compatibility** (HIGH RISK)
- Verify all existing functionality still works
- **Risk:** Regressions in streaming, tool calling, error handling
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive regression test suite

**Epic 3.6: Configuration Updates** (LOW RISK)
- Update .env.example, deployment guide
- **Risk:** Documentation drift, missing configuration
- **Mitigation:** Systematic documentation review

### De-Risking Actions (Do NOW)

**1. Document Current State:**
```bash
# Save current environment
pip freeze > docs/upgrades/wave3-pre-upgrade-environment.txt

# Document current model configuration
# (from .env or config files)

# Backup critical provider code
cp src/providers/glm_chat.py src/providers/glm_chat.py.wave2-backup
```

**2. Create Rollback Plan:**
```bash
# Backup requirements.txt
cp requirements.txt requirements.txt.wave2-backup

# Document rollback procedure
# (create wave3-rollback-procedure.md)

# Test rollback in isolated environment
# (verify can revert to zai-sdk v0.0.3.3)
```

**3. Prepare Test Cases:**
- **Critical Path Tests:**
  - Streaming functionality (GLM and Kimi)
  - Tool calling integration
  - Error handling and fallback logic
  - Web search integration
  
- **Regression Test Suite:**
  - All existing functionality must continue working
  - Backward compatibility verification
  - No breaking changes validation

- **Smoke Tests for GLM-4.6:**
  - 200K context window functionality
  - Token efficiency improvements (~15%)
  - Pricing configuration ($0.60/$2.20)

**4. Review Dual SDK/HTTP Pattern:**
- **Study:** `src/providers/glm_chat.py` lines 52-61, 107, 116
- **Understand:** Fallback logic (SDK primary, HTTP fallback)
- **Plan:** Modifications for zai-sdk v0.0.4 (maintain pattern)

**5. Validate NO BREAKING CHANGES:**
- Re-confirm with latest zai-sdk v0.0.4 documentation
- Check for any undocumented changes
- Verify API compatibility
