# zai-sdk v0.0.4 Upgrade - Dependency Matrix

**Created:** 2025-10-02  
**Tool Used:** planner_EXAI-WS  
**Purpose:** Map dependencies between Waves 2-6 for efficient execution planning

---

## Executive Summary

This dependency matrix maps all dependencies for the zai-sdk v0.0.4 upgrade project (Waves 2-6). The analysis identifies:

- **Critical Path:** Wave 1 → Wave 2 (Epic 2.1) → Wave 3 (Epics 3.1-3.6) → Wave 4 (Epic 4.6) → Wave 5 (Epic 5.6) → Wave 6 (Epic 6.6)
- **Parallelization Opportunities:** 42% time savings possible through concurrent task execution
- **Bottlenecks:** Wave 3 (SDK Upgrade) is the longest sequential chain
- **Quality Gates:** 3 decision points (Tasks 1.4.4, Epic 2.5, Epic 5.6)

**Project Structure:**
- **6 Waves:** Research → Synthesis → SDK Upgrade → New Features → Testing → Release
- **24 Epics:** Organized by wave
- **59 Tasks:** Detailed implementation steps

---

## Dependency Types

### 1. Hard Dependencies (Technical Prerequisites)

**Definition:** Task B cannot start until Task A completes due to technical requirements.

**Examples:**
- SDK must be upgraded (Wave 3) before new features can be implemented (Wave 4)
- Test environment must be set up (Epic 3.1) before SDK can be installed (Epic 3.2)
- Backward compatibility must be verified (Epic 3.5) before new features begin (Wave 4)

**Impact:** Blocks downstream work completely

---

### 2. Soft Dependencies (UX Improvements Inform Implementation)

**Definition:** Task B benefits from Task A completion but can technically proceed without it.

**Examples:**
- Epic 2.3 (EXAI Tool UX Improvements) informs Epic 3.3 (Provider Code Updates)
- Epic 2.2 (Web Search Fix) improves Epic 4.5 (Documentation) quality
- Epic 2.4 (Diagnostic Tools) helps Epic 5.1 (Test Suite) development

**Impact:** Reduces rework and improves quality if respected

---

### 3. Risk Dependencies (Critical Path Items)

**Definition:** Tasks on the critical path that block multiple downstream tasks.

**Examples:**
- Epic 2.1 (Research Synthesis) blocks all Wave 2 improvements
- Wave 3 (SDK Upgrade) blocks all new features in Wave 4
- Epic 5.6 (Quality Gate) blocks release preparation in Wave 6

**Impact:** Delays cascade to multiple dependent tasks

---

## Inter-Wave Dependencies

### Wave 1 → Wave 2

**Dependency:** Task 1.4.4 (Decision Gate) MUST complete before Wave 2 starts

**Type:** Hard (Quality Gate)

**Criteria:**
- All 5 user guides complete and validated
- Research synthesis complete (Tasks 2.4, 2.5 at 100%)
- EXAI tool UX analysis complete
- Dependency matrix created (this document)

**Blocker If Not Met:** Wave 2 cannot start

---

### Wave 2 → Wave 3

**Dependency:** Epic 2.1 (Research Synthesis) MUST complete before Epic 3.1 (Test Environment)

**Type:** Hard (Technical)

**Reason:** Research synthesis provides:
- Breaking changes analysis (informs testing strategy)
- New features documentation (guides implementation)
- API changes mapping (required for provider updates)

**Blocker If Not Met:** Wave 3 implementation will lack critical information

---

### Wave 3 → Wave 4

**Dependency:** Epic 3.5 (Backward Compatibility) MUST complete before any Wave 4 epics

**Type:** Hard (Technical)

**Reason:** New features require:
- Stable SDK foundation (zai-sdk v0.0.4 installed)
- Verified backward compatibility (no regressions)
- GLM-4.6 integration complete (200K context available)

**Blocker If Not Met:** New features may break existing functionality

---

### Wave 4 → Wave 5

**Dependency:** Epic 4.6 (Integration Testing) MUST complete before Epic 5.1 (Test Suite)

**Type:** Hard (Technical)

**Reason:** Comprehensive testing requires:
- All new features implemented and tested independently
- Integration points identified and validated
- Known issues documented

**Blocker If Not Met:** Test suite will be incomplete

---

### Wave 5 → Wave 6

**Dependency:** Epic 5.6 (Quality Gate) MUST complete before any Wave 6 epics

**Type:** Hard (Quality Gate)

**Criteria:**
- All tests passing (>80% coverage)
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance meets requirements
- Turnkey deployment verified
- All examples working

**Blocker If Not Met:** Release will be premature

## Parallelization Opportunities

### Summary Table

| Wave | Total Epics | Sequential | Parallel | Time Savings |
|------|-------------|------------|----------|--------------|
| Wave 2 | 5 | 2 | 3 | 33% |
| Wave 3 | 6 | 6 | 0 | 0% |
| Wave 4 | 6 | 2 | 4 | 50% |
| Wave 5 | 6 | 1 | 5 | 67% |
| Wave 6 | 6 | 2 | 4 | 50% |
| **Total** | **29** | **13** | **16** | **42%** |

### Overall Time Savings

**Without Parallelization:** 29 epic-units (sequential)

**With Parallelization:** 17 epic-units (parallel where possible)

**Time Savings:** 42% reduction in total timeline

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Bottlenecks

**1. Epic 2.1 (Research Synthesis)**
- **Risk:** Blocks all Wave 2 improvements
- **Mitigation:** Prioritize completion, allocate extra resources
- **Impact:** Delays cascade to Epics 2.2, 2.3, 2.4

**2. Wave 3 (SDK Upgrade)**
- **Risk:** Longest sequential chain (6 epics)
- **Mitigation:** Monitor progress closely, identify blockers early
- **Impact:** Delays affect all downstream waves

**3. Epic 5.6 (Quality Gate)**
- **Risk:** Blocks release preparation
- **Mitigation:** Start validation early, maintain quality throughout
- **Impact:** Delays release timeline

### Quality Gates

**1. Task 1.4.4 (Wave 1 Decision Gate)**
- **Purpose:** Verify Wave 1 completeness before Wave 2
- **Criteria:** All guides complete, research synthesis done, dependency matrix created
- **Action:** Allocate buffer time for remediation if needed

**2. Epic 2.5 (Wave 2 Validation)**
- **Purpose:** Verify UX improvements work correctly
- **Criteria:** Web search fix validated, tool UX improvements tested, no regressions
- **Action:** Test thoroughly before proceeding to Wave 3

**3. Epic 5.6 (Wave 5 Quality Gate)**
- **Purpose:** Final quality check before release
- **Criteria:** All tests passing, no critical vulnerabilities, performance validated
- **Action:** Do not compromise on quality - delay release if needed

## Execution Recommendations

### 1. Respect Hard Dependencies

**Rule:** Never start a task before its hard dependencies complete

**Example:** Do not start Wave 4 (New Features) until Epic 3.5 (Backward Compatibility) is verified

**Reason:** Technical prerequisites must be met to avoid rework

### 2. Maximize Parallelization

**Rule:** Run independent tasks concurrently whenever possible

**Example:** In Wave 4, implement Epics 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 simultaneously

**Benefit:** 42% time savings across the project

### 3. Monitor Critical Path

**Rule:** Track progress on critical path items daily

**Focus:** Wave 3 (SDK Upgrade) is the longest sequential chain

**Action:** Identify and resolve blockers immediately

### 4. Allocate Buffer Time for Quality Gates

**Rule:** Add 20% buffer time before each quality gate

**Gates:** Task 1.4.4, Epic 2.5, Epic 5.6

**Reason:** Quality gates often reveal issues requiring remediation

### 5. Communicate Dependencies

**Rule:** Ensure all team members understand task dependencies

**Tool:** Use this dependency matrix as reference

**Benefit:** Prevents premature starts and reduces rework
