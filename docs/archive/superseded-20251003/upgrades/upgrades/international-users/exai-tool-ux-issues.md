## 1. Web Search Prompt Injection Issue

**Task:** 1.3.1  
**Tool:** `chat_EXAI-WS` with `use_websearch=true`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM (impacts workflow efficiency but doesn't block work)  
**Status:** ✅ DOCUMENTED - Awaiting Wave 2 fix

### 1.1 Expected Behavior

When `use_websearch=true` is set, the chat tool should:
1. Autonomously detect when web search is needed
2. Execute web searches without user intervention
3. Integrate search results seamlessly into responses
4. Provide complete, synthesized answers using search data

**Example Expected Flow:**
```
User: "What are the latest features in zai-sdk version 0.0.4?"
Tool: [Autonomously searches] → [Synthesizes results] → [Returns complete answer]
```

### 1.2 Actual Behavior Observed

**Test Case 1: Direct Research Query**
```json
{
  "prompt": "What are the latest features in zai-sdk version 0.0.4? I need information about the new API endpoints and capabilities added in this version.",
  "use_websearch": true,
  "model": "auto"
}
```

**Response:**
```
"I'll help you find information about the latest features in zai-sdk version 0.0.4. 
Let me search for the most current information about this SDK's recent updates.

---

AGENT'S TURN: Evaluate this perspective alongside your analysis to form a 
comprehensive solution and continue with the user's request and task at hand."
```

**Metadata Shows Search Executed:**
```json
"tool_call_events": [{
  "provider": "kimi",
  "tool_name": "web_search",
  "args": {},
  "start_ts": 1759356492.751445
}]
```

**Test Case 2: Explicit Search Request**
```json
{
  "prompt": "Search the web for information about GLM-4.6 model specifications, context window size, and pricing from Z.ai documentation.",
  "use_websearch": true,
  "model": "auto"
}
```

**Response:**
```
"I'll search for information about the GLM-4.6 model specifications, context 
window size, and pricing from Z.ai documentation.

---

AGENT'S TURN: Evaluate this perspective alongside your analysis to form a 
comprehensive solution and continue with the user's request and task at hand."
```

### 1.3 Analysis of Actual Behavior

**Key Findings:**
1. ✅ Web search IS executing (confirmed by `tool_call_events` in metadata)
2. ❌ Response is incomplete - ends with "AGENT'S TURN" message
3. ❌ Search results are NOT integrated into the response
4. ❌ User receives no actionable information despite search executing

**This is DIFFERENT from the documented issue in wave1-handover.md:**
- Documented: "SEARCH REQUIRED: Please immediately perform a web search..."
- Actual: Search executes but results aren't returned/synthesized

### 1.4 Root Cause Analysis

**Hypothesis 1: Response Truncation**
- Search executes successfully (metadata confirms)
- Response appears truncated before search results are integrated
- "AGENT'S TURN" suggests multi-turn conversation flow not completing

**Hypothesis 2: System Prompt Architecture**
- System prompt may be designed for multi-turn conversations
- Expects continuation_id to be used for follow-up
- Single-turn usage doesn't complete the full cycle

**Hypothesis 3: Provider-Specific Behavior**
- Uses Kimi provider (`kimi-k2-0905-preview`)
- Kimi's web search integration may require specific response handling
- Results may be available but not properly extracted/formatted

### 1.5 User Impact Assessment

**Impact Level:** MEDIUM

**Workflow Disruption:**
- ⏱️ Slows research tasks (requires workaround)
- 🔄 Forces use of alternative tools (`web-search` directly)
- 📉 Reduces confidence in tool autonomy
- ❌ Doesn't block work (workaround available)

**User Experience Issues:**
- Confusing "AGENT'S TURN" message (who is the agent?)
- Unclear whether search succeeded or failed
- No indication of how to get the search results
- Breaks expectation of autonomous behavior

**Frequency:** HIGH - Affects all research workflows using chat tool

### 1.6 Current Workaround

**Recommended Approach:**
Use `web-search` tool directly instead of `chat_EXAI-WS` with `use_websearch=true`

**Example:**
```json
{
  "tool": "web-search",
  "query": "zai-sdk version 0.0.4 features and API endpoints",
  "num_results": 5
}
```

**Workaround Effectiveness:** ✅ HIGH - Provides complete search results

### 1.7 Proposed Fix for Wave 2

**Priority:** HIGH (impacts all research workflows)

**Recommended Solutions:**

**Option A: Fix Response Completion**
1. Investigate why responses truncate before search results
2. Ensure search results are properly extracted from Kimi provider
3. Integrate results into response before returning
4. Test with various query types

**Option B: Improve Multi-Turn Handling**
1. If multi-turn is intended, make it explicit in response
2. Provide clear instructions on using continuation_id
3. Auto-continue if single-turn usage detected
4. Return complete results in first response when possible

**Option C: Enhanced Error Messaging**
1. If search fails, provide clear error message
2. If results pending, explain continuation process
3. If workaround needed, suggest `web-search` tool
4. Never leave user with ambiguous "AGENT'S TURN" message

**Testing Requirements:**
- [ ] Test with 10+ different query types
- [ ] Verify search results integration
- [ ] Test single-turn vs multi-turn usage
- [ ] Validate with Kimi and GLM providers
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility

### 1.8 Related Issues

- **Issue 2:** continuation_id messaging (see Section 2)
- **Issue 4.2:** Multi-turn workflow rigidity (see Section 4)

---

## 2. continuation_id Messaging Rigidity

**Task:** 1.3.2  
**Tool:** Multiple EXAI tools  
**Severity:** LOW (confusing but doesn't block work)  
**Status:** 🚧 IN PROGRESS - Documenting examples

### 2.1 The Problem

**User's Concern:**
> "Claude to use the continuation_id when you do" - this message doesn't make sense if Claude isn't using the tool itself.

**Context:**
- EXAI tools return `continuation_offer` with messaging about continuation_id
- Messages assume "Claude" is the user/consumer of the tool
- In reality, Claude (Augment Agent) is calling the tool on behalf of the user
- Messaging should be context-aware based on actual usage pattern

### 2.2 Examples of Rigid Messaging

**Example 1: chat_EXAI-WS Response**
```json
{
  "continuation_offer": {
    "continuation_id": "39048d92-d30e-4cdb-b18a-dbf52e885b02",
    "note": "Claude can continue this conversation for 19 more exchanges.",
    "remaining_turns": 19
  }
}
```

**Example 2: thinkdeep_EXAI-WS Response**
```json
{
  "continuation_id": "fde1185b-127d-4f02-9689-74793f41a4fa",
  "next_call": {
    "tool": "thinkdeep",
    "arguments": {
      "step": "...",
      "step_number": 1,
      "total_steps": 1,
      "next_step_required": false,
      "continuation_id": "fde1185b-127d-4f02-9689-74793f41a4fa"
    }
  }
}
```

**Example 3: Generic Pattern Across All Tools**
- Same continuation_id structure
- No context-aware messaging
- Assumes caller knows what to do with continuation_id

**Why This Is Confusing:**
1. **"Claude can continue"** - but Claude (Augment Agent) is the one calling the tool, not the end user
2. **Assumes knowledge** - doesn't explain what continuation_id does or when to use it
3. **Generic messaging** - same message regardless of context (single-turn vs multi-turn intent)
4. **No guidance** - doesn't tell you HOW to use continuation_id
5. **Breaks abstraction** - mentions "Claude" specifically, tying to one use case

### 2.3 Expected Flexible Behavior

**Context-Aware Messaging:**

**Scenario 1: Single-Turn Usage (No continuation_id provided)**
```json
{
  "continuation_offer": {
    "continuation_id": "abc123",
    "note": "This conversation can be continued. Pass this continuation_id in your next call to maintain context.",
    "remaining_turns": 19
  }
}
```

**Scenario 2: Multi-Turn Usage (continuation_id provided)**
```json
{
  "continuation_offer": {
    "continuation_id": "abc123",
    "note": "Conversation continued. 18 turns remaining in this thread.",
    "remaining_turns": 18
  }
}
```

**Scenario 3: Final Turn**
```json
{
  "continuation_offer": {
    "continuation_id": null,
    "note": "Conversation complete. No continuation available.",
    "remaining_turns": 0
  }
}
```

### 2.4 Root Cause Analysis

**Hypothesis:**
- System prompts/response templates are hardcoded
- No detection of caller context (AI agent vs human user)
- No detection of usage pattern (single vs multi-turn)
- Generic messaging applied to all scenarios

**Evidence:**
- Same message format across all tools
- No variation based on continuation_id presence in request
- "Claude" reference suggests template designed for specific use case

### 2.5 User Impact

**Impact Level:** LOW

**Issues:**
- Confusing for developers reading tool outputs
- Unclear when/how to use continuation_id
- Breaks immersion (reminds user they're using Claude)
- Doesn't provide actionable guidance

**Frequency:** HIGH - Every tool call with continuation support

### 2.6 Proposed Fix for Wave 2

**Priority:** MEDIUM (UX improvement, not critical)

**Solution: Dynamic Context-Aware Messaging**

1. **Detect Caller Context:**
   - Check if continuation_id was provided in request
   - Determine if this is first call or continuation
   - Adapt message based on context

2. **Improve Message Content:**
   - Remove "Claude" references (use "you" or "the caller")
   - Explain what continuation_id does
   - Provide usage example when relevant
   - Be concise but informative

3. **Implementation:**
   ```python
   def generate_continuation_message(request, response):
       if request.get('continuation_id'):
           # Continuing existing conversation
           return f"Conversation continued. {remaining} turns remaining."
       else:
           # New conversation
           return f"To continue this conversation, include continuation_id='{cid}' in your next request."
   ```

**Testing:**
- [ ] Test with continuation_id present
- [ ] Test without continuation_id
- [ ] Test final turn (remaining=0)
- [ ] Verify message clarity with users

## 3. Path Validation UX Issues

**Task:** 1.3.3  
**Tool:** `analyze_EXAI-WS` and other file-based tools  
**Severity:** MEDIUM (blocks usage until understood)  
**Status:** 🚧 IN PROGRESS - Collecting examples

### 3.1 The Problem

**Error Message:**
```
All file paths must be FULL absolute paths. Invalid path: "."
```

**User Confusion:**
- Why can't I use relative paths?
- Why can't I use current directory (`.`)?
- What is a "FULL absolute path"?
- How do I convert my path to the correct format?

### 3.2 Examples of Rejected Paths

**Test Cases (Actual Testing Evidence):**

| Input Path | Rejected? | Actual Error Message | Tool Tested |
|------------|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| `.` | ✅ YES | `All file paths must be FULL absolute paths. Invalid path: '.'` | analyze_EXAI-WS |
| `src/providers` | ✅ YES | `All file paths must be FULL absolute paths. Invalid path: 'src/providers'` | analyze_EXAI-WS |
| `./providers/glm_chat.py` | ✅ YES | (Expected: same pattern) | (Not tested) |
| `providers/glm_chat.py` | ✅ YES | (Expected: same pattern) | (Not tested) |
| `c:\Project\EX-AI-MCP-Server\src` | ❌ NO | (Accepted) | Multiple tools |
| `c:\\Project\\EX-AI-MCP-Server\\src` | ❌ NO | (Accepted - JSON escaped) | Multiple tools |

**Additional Test Cases:**

| Input Path | Platform | Expected Result | Notes |
|------------|----------|-----------------|-------|
| `/home/user/project/src` | Linux | ✅ Accepted | Absolute path from root |
| `~/project/src` | Linux | ❌ Rejected | Tilde expansion not supported |
| `%USERPROFILE%\project` | Windows | ❌ Rejected | Environment variables not expanded |
| `C:/Project/...` | Windows | ✅ Accepted | Forward slashes work on Windows |

### 3.3 Current Workaround

**Documented in wave1-handover.md:**
> "CRITICAL: c:\\\\Project\\\\... not src/..."

**Correct Format:**
- Windows: `c:\\Project\\EX-AI-MCP-Server\\src\\providers\\glm_chat.py`
- Must use double backslashes in JSON: `c:\\\\Project\\\\...`
- Must be absolute from drive root

### 3.4 Why This Is a UX Issue

**Problems:**
1. **Error message doesn't help:** Doesn't show example of correct format
2. **No path conversion:** Tool could convert relative → absolute
3. **Platform-specific:** Windows vs Linux path handling unclear
4. **Escaping confusion:** Single vs double backslash requirements
5. **No validation feedback:** Doesn't suggest corrections

### 3.5 Proposed Improvements

**Better Error Message:**
```
Error: Path must be absolute.

Received: "src/"
Expected: "c:\\Project\\EX-AI-MCP-Server\\src"

Tip: Use full path from drive root (Windows) or / (Linux).
Example: c:\\Project\\EX-AI-MCP-Server\\src\\providers\\glm_chat.py
```

**Auto-Conversion (Optional):**
```python
def normalize_path(path, workspace_root):
    if not os.path.isabs(path):
        # Convert relative to absolute
        abs_path = os.path.join(workspace_root, path)
        logger.info(f"Converted relative path '{path}' to '{abs_path}'")
        return abs_path
    return path
```

**Validation with Suggestions:**
- Detect common mistakes (`.`, `./`, relative paths)
- Suggest correct absolute path
- Show platform-specific examples

## 4. Tool Rigidity Patterns

**Task:** 1.3.4  
**Status:** 🚧 IN PROGRESS - Identifying 5 specific cases

### 4.1 Pattern 1: Fixed Step Counts

**Tools Affected:** `thinkdeep_EXAI-WS`, `analyze_EXAI-WS`, `debug_EXAI-WS`

**Rigid Behavior:**
- Requires `total_steps` to be specified upfront
- Difficult to adjust mid-workflow
- Forces artificial step boundaries

**Expected Flexible Behavior:**
- Allow dynamic step adjustment
- Support "unknown" total steps
- Auto-determine steps based on complexity

**User Impact:** Forces premature planning, reduces adaptability

### 4.2 Pattern 2: Multi-Turn Workflow Assumptions

**Tools Affected:** `chat_EXAI-WS`, workflow tools

**Rigid Behavior:**
- Assumes multi-turn conversations
- Incomplete responses in single-turn usage
- "AGENT'S TURN" messaging (see Issue 1)

**Expected Flexible Behavior:**
- Detect single vs multi-turn intent
- Complete responses in single-turn mode
- Clear guidance for multi-turn usage

**User Impact:** Confusing responses, unclear workflow

### 4.3 Pattern 3: Confidence Level Rigidity

**Tools Affected:** `debug_EXAI-WS`, `codereview_EXAI-WS`, `precommit_EXAI-WS`, `refactor_EXAI-WS`

**Rigid Behavior:**
- Fixed confidence levels: exploring, low, medium, high, very_high, almost_certain, certain
- "certain" level prevents external validation (use_assistant_model disabled)
- No guidance on when to use each level
- Unclear what "200% confidence" means in practice

**Example from Documentation:**
```
"confidence": "certain (200% confidence - analysis is complete and all issues
are identified with no need for external model validation). Do NOT use 'certain'
unless the pre-commit validation is thoroughly complete"
```

**Issues:**
1. **Unclear thresholds:** When is "high" vs "very_high" vs "almost_certain"?
2. **Binary decision:** "certain" completely disables validation - no middle ground
3. **Subjective assessment:** No objective criteria for confidence levels
4. **Risk of overconfidence:** Easy to select "certain" prematurely

**Expected Flexible Behavior:**
- Provide objective criteria for each confidence level
- Allow partial validation even at "certain" level
- Support confidence ranges (e.g., "high-to-very_high")
- Auto-suggest confidence based on analysis depth

**User Impact:** Risk of skipping important validation, unclear decision-making

### 4.4 Pattern 4: Required vs Optional Parameter Confusion

**Tools Affected:** All EXAI tools

**Rigid Behavior:**
- Some parameters marked "required" but have defaults
- Optional parameters not clearly documented
- No indication of which parameters are commonly used
- Error messages don't distinguish required vs optional

**Example: analyze_EXAI-WS**
```json
{
  "step": "required",
  "step_number": "required",
  "total_steps": "required",
  "next_step_required": "required",
  "findings": "required",
  "relevant_files": "optional but commonly needed",
  "files_checked": "optional but recommended",
  "confidence": "optional with default",
  "model": "optional with default 'auto'"
}
```

**Issues:**
1. **Unclear defaults:** What happens if optional parameter omitted?
2. **No usage guidance:** Which optional parameters should I use?
3. **Verbose requirements:** Too many "required" parameters for simple tasks
4. **No parameter groups:** Can't see which parameters go together

**Expected Flexible Behavior:**
- Clear documentation of defaults
- Usage examples showing common parameter combinations
- Parameter groups (e.g., "basic", "advanced", "debugging")
- Smart defaults based on task type

**User Impact:** Verbose tool calls, uncertainty about parameter usage

### 4.5 Pattern 5: Error Recovery Rigidity

**Tools Affected:** All workflow tools (thinkdeep, debug, analyze, etc.)

**Rigid Behavior:**
- Errors abort entire workflow
- No automatic retry mechanisms
- No partial result recovery
- Must restart from step 1 after error

**Example Scenario:**
```
Step 1: ✅ Complete
Step 2: ✅ Complete
Step 3: ❌ Error (path validation failed)
Result: All progress lost, must restart from Step 1
```

**Issues:**
1. **No checkpointing:** Can't resume from last successful step
2. **No error recovery:** Tool doesn't suggest fixes
3. **All-or-nothing:** Can't get partial results
4. **Wasted work:** Must repeat successful steps

**Expected Flexible Behavior:**
- Save progress after each step
- Allow resumption from last successful step
- Provide partial results even if workflow incomplete
- Suggest fixes for common errors (e.g., path validation)

**User Impact:** Frustration from lost work, inefficient workflows

**Real-World Example:**
During Wave 1 research, if analyze_EXAI-WS fails on step 3 due to path error:
- Lost: Steps 1-2 analysis work
- Required: Fix path AND restart entire analysis
- Better: Fix path, resume from step 3

## 5. UX Improvement Recommendations

**Task:** 1.3.5
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Synthesized from Tasks 1.3.1-1.3.4

### 5.1 Prioritization Framework

**Criteria:**
1. **User Impact:** High (blocks work) / Medium (slows work) / Low (minor annoyance)
2. **Implementation Complexity:** Easy (<1 day) / Medium (1-3 days) / Hard (>3 days)
3. **Frequency:** High (every use) / Medium (common) / Low (rare)
4. **Priority Score:** Impact × Frequency ÷ Complexity

### 5.2 Prioritized Improvement List

| 8 | Dynamic Step Adjustment | LOW | HARD | LOW | 🟢 LOW | Wave 4+ |

### 5.3 Wave 2 Implementation Roadmap

**Epic 2.2: Web Search Prompt Injection Fix** (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Search executes but results not integrated into response

**Solution:**
1. Investigate response truncation in chat_EXAI-WS
2. Ensure Kimi provider search results are properly extracted
3. Integrate results before returning response
4. Test single-turn vs multi-turn usage patterns

**Implementation Steps:**
```python
# Pseudo-code for fix
def chat_with_websearch(prompt, use_websearch=True):
    response = kimi_provider.chat(prompt)

    if use_websearch and response.tool_calls:
        # Extract web search results
        search_results = extract_search_results(response)

        # Integrate into response
        complete_response = synthesize_with_results(
            original_response=response,
            search_results=search_results
        )

        return complete_response

    return response
```

**Testing:**
- [ ] Test 10+ query types (research, factual, current events)
- [ ] Verify results integration
- [ ] Test with Kimi and GLM providers
- [ ] Validate single-turn completeness

**Before/After Example:**

**Before:**
```
User: "What are the latest features in zai-sdk v0.0.4?"
Response: "I'll search for that information.

---

AGENT'S TURN: Evaluate this perspective..."
```

**After:**
```
User: "What are the latest features in zai-sdk v0.0.4?"
Response: "Based on web search results, zai-sdk v0.0.4 includes:

1. GLM-4.6 model support (200K context window)
2. Video generation API (CogVideoX-2)
3. Assistant API for structured conversations
4. Character role-playing (CharGLM-3)
5. Enhanced file upload capabilities

[Sources: PyPI, GitHub, Z.ai documentation]"
```

---

**Epic 2.3: EXAI Tool UX Improvements**

**Improvement 1: Path Validation Error Messages** (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Current Error:**
```
All file paths must be FULL absolute paths. Invalid path: 'src/providers'
```

**Improved Error:**
```
Error: Path must be absolute.

Received: "src/providers"
Expected: "c:\\Project\\EX-AI-MCP-Server\\src\\providers"

Tip: Use full path from drive root (Windows) or / (Linux).

Common mistakes:
  ❌ "." (current directory)
  ❌ "src/" (relative path)
  ❌ "./file.py" (relative with ./prefix)
  ✅ "c:\\Project\\EX-AI-MCP-Server\\src\\file.py" (absolute)

Need help? The workspace root is: c:\\Project\\EX-AI-MCP-Server
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def validate_path(path, workspace_root):
    if not os.path.isabs(path):
        # Generate helpful error
        abs_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(workspace_root, path))

        raise PathValidationError(
            f"Error: Path must be absolute.\n\n"
            f"Received: \"{path}\"\n"
            f"Expected: \"{abs_path}\"\n\n"
            f"Tip: Use full path from drive root (Windows) or / (Linux).\n\n"
            f"Common mistakes:\n"
            f"  ❌ \".\" (current directory)\n"
            f"  ❌ \"src/\" (relative path)\n"
            f"  ✅ \"{abs_path}\" (absolute)\n\n"
            f"Workspace root: {workspace_root}"
        )

    return path
```

**Testing:**
- [ ] Test all rejected path patterns
- [ ] Verify error message clarity
- [ ] Test on Windows and Linux
- [ ] User feedback on helpfulness

---

**Improvement 2: continuation_id Context-Aware Messaging** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current Messaging:**
```json
{
  "continuation_offer": {
    "continuation_id": "abc123",
    "note": "Claude can continue this conversation for 19 more exchanges."
  }
}
```

**Improved Messaging:**

**Scenario 1: First Call (No continuation_id provided)**
```json
{
  "continuation_offer": {
    "continuation_id": "abc123",
    "note": "To continue this conversation, include 'continuation_id: abc123' in your next request. 19 turns remaining.",
    "usage_example": {
      "tool": "chat_EXAI-WS",
      "params": {
        "prompt": "Follow-up question...",
        "continuation_id": "abc123"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Scenario 2: Continuation Call (continuation_id provided)**
```json
{
  "continuation_offer": {
    "continuation_id": "abc123",
    "note": "Conversation continued. 18 turns remaining in this thread."
  }
}
```

**Scenario 3: Final Turn**
```json
{
  "continuation_offer": {
    "continuation_id": null,
    "note": "Conversation complete. Maximum turns reached."
  }
}
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def generate_continuation_message(request, response, remaining_turns):
    cid = response.continuation_id

    if request.get('continuation_id'):
        # Continuing existing conversation
        if remaining_turns > 0:
            return f"Conversation continued. {remaining_turns} turns remaining."
        else:
            return "Conversation complete. Maximum turns reached."
    else:
        # New conversation
        if remaining_turns > 0:
            return (
                f"To continue this conversation, include "
                f"'continuation_id: {cid}' in your next request. "
                f"{remaining_turns} turns remaining."
            )
        else:
            return "Single-turn conversation complete."
```

---

**Improvement 3: Parameter Documentation Enhancement** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current State:**
- Parameters documented in tool descriptions
- No clear indication of common usage patterns
- Defaults not always obvious

**Improved Documentation:**

Create `docs/guides/parameter-reference.md` with:

1. **Parameter Groups:**
   - Core (always required)
   - Common (frequently used)
   - Advanced (optional, for specific use cases)
   - Debugging (for troubleshooting)

2. **Usage Examples:**
   - Minimal example (only required params)
   - Standard example (common params)
   - Advanced example (all params)

### 5.4 Wave 3+ Improvements (Deferred)

**Improvement 4: Error Recovery & Checkpointing** (Wave 3)

**Problem:** Workflow errors lose all progress

**Solution:**
- Implement step-level checkpointing
- Allow resumption from last successful step
- Provide partial results on error
- Auto-suggest fixes for common errors

**Complexity:** HIGH (requires architecture changes)

---

**Improvement 5: Confidence Level Guidance** (Wave 3)

**Problem:** Unclear when to use each confidence level

**Solution:**
- Provide objective criteria for each level
- Auto-suggest confidence based on analysis depth
- Allow partial validation at "certain" level
- Create confidence assessment guide

**Complexity:** MEDIUM (requires documentation + logic)

---

**Improvement 6: Dynamic Step Adjustment** (Wave 4+)

**Problem:** Must specify total_steps upfront

**Solution:**
- Support "unknown" total steps
- Allow mid-workflow step adjustment
- Auto-determine steps based on complexity
- Flexible workflow boundaries

**Complexity:** HARD (requires workflow engine changes)
