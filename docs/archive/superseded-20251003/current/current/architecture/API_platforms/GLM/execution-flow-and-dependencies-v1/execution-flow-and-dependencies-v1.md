## Scope
- Entry points from external clients to response delivery (stdio MCP and WS daemon)
- Inter-script dependencies (imports/calls) along the critical path
- GLM/Z.ai flows: glm_multi_file_chat, glm_agent_* and glm_web_search
- Cleanup preparation: critical vs legacy/duplicate vs orphaned vs dev-only
- Staging strategy for safe removals
