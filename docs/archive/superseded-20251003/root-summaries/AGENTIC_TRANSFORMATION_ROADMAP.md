# AGENTIC TRANSFORMATION ROADMAP

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-02  
**Purpose:** Master guide for transforming EX-AI-MCP-Server from rigid workflows to intelligent, goal-oriented agents

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap transforms our MCP server from a rigid, step-count-driven system into an intelligent, goal-oriented agent capable of self-assessment, dynamic adaptation, and autonomous decision-making. The transformation enables 20-40% faster simple tasks, 10-15% deeper complex investigations, and 15-25% token savings while maintaining full backward compatibility.

---

## Current State

**Architecture:** WebSocket daemon with provider registry  
**Constraints:** Fixed step counts, mandatory pauses, no self-assessment  
**Tools:** 9 workflow tools with rigid 2-8 step enforcement  
**Behavior:** "Well-behaved assistant" - follows instructions without adaptation  
**Limitations:** Cannot adjust depth, terminate early, or assess goal completion

---

## Target State

**Vision:** "Intelligent agent" - autonomously determines investigation depth, adjusts strategy mid-flight, and terminates when goals are achieved  
**Core Capabilities:**
- Self-assessment of information sufficiency
- Dynamic step adjustment based on complexity
- Early termination on high confidence
- AI Manager for intelligent step planning
- Transparent reasoning for all decisions
