# Kimi-Powered Codebase Audit Strategy

**Date:** 2025-10-03  
**Status:** VALIDATED BY EXAI  
**Confidence:** VERY HIGH

---

## ✅ EXAI VALIDATION COMPLETE

### **User's Strategic Approach: CONFIRMED CORRECT**

**Proposal:**
1. Upload `docs/system-reference/` to Kimi as **design intent baseline**
2. Then upload all project files (scripts, code, other docs)
3. Have Kimi audit everything against the baseline
4. Identify: what to keep, adjust, or remove

**EXAI Verdict:** ✅ **APPROVED** - This is the optimal approach.

## 📊 EXAI ANALYSIS FINDINGS

### **1. System-Reference IS the Definitive Baseline** ✅

**Evidence:**
- **README.md Line 5:** "Purpose: Definitive reference for EX-AI-MCP-Server architecture and functionality"
- **README.md Line 11:** "authoritative source for understanding how the complete EX-AI-MCP-Server system operates"
- **README.md Line 310:** "Purpose: Consolidate all system knowledge in one authoritative location"
- **Version:** 1.0 (Last Updated: 2025-10-02)

**Comprehensive Coverage:**
1. `01-system-overview.md` - System definition, target audience (api.z.ai international)
2. `02-provider-architecture.md` - GLM (zai-sdk v0.0.4, GLM-4.6) + Kimi providers
3. `03-tool-ecosystem.md` - All tools (simple + workflow + agentic enhancements)
4. `04-features-and-capabilities.md` - Streaming, web search, multimodal
5. `05-api-endpoints-reference.md` - Complete API reference
6. `06-deployment-guide.md` - Installation, deployment, troubleshooting
7. `07-upgrade-roadmap.md` - Current upgrade project (zai-sdk v0.0.4)

**Design Intent Clearly Stated:**
- **Target:** International users using api.z.ai (NOT mainland China)
- **Architecture:** Manager-first agentic routing
- **Providers:** GLM (zai-sdk v0.0.4) + Kimi (Moonshot API)
- **Protocol:** WebSocket MCP daemon on ws://127.0.0.1:8765
- **Tools:** Simple tools + workflow tools with agentic enhancements

### **2. Redundant/Conflicting Folders Identified** ⚠️

#### **CRITICAL: Documentation Duplication**

**A. `docs/current/` - OVERLAPS with system-reference**
```
docs/current/
├── tools/               ⚠️  15 tool docs → DUPLICATES system-reference/03-tool-ecosystem.md
├── architecture/        ⚠️  Implementation plans → DUPLICATES system-reference/02-provider-architecture.md
└── policies/            ✅ AUGMENT_CODE_GUIDELINES.md → KEEP (not in system-reference)
```

**B. `docs/architecture/` - Historical Phase Docs**
```
docs/architecture/
├── phase-0-summary.md           ⚠️  Historical → ARCHIVE
├── phase-1-*.md                 ⚠️  Historical → ARCHIVE
├── system-overview.md           ⚠️  DUPLICATES system-reference/01-system-overview.md
└── design-philosophy.md         ⚠️  Should be in system-reference?
```

**C. `docs/upgrades/` - Overlaps with system-reference**
```
docs/upgrades/
├── international-users/         ⚠️  Should be in system-reference?
└── investigation-summary.md     ⚠️  Overlaps with 07-upgrade-roadmap.md
```

---

### **3. Maintainability Issues**

**Current Structure:**
```
docs/
├── system-reference/     ✅ DEFINITIVE BASELINE
├── guides/               ✅ User guides (good)
├── architecture/         ⚠️  OVERLAPS with system-reference
├── current/              ⚠️  UNCLEAR PURPOSE
├── upgrades/             ⚠️  OVERLAPS with system-reference
├── ux/                   ✅ UX improvements (good)
└── archive/              ✅ Archived docs (good)
```

**Problems:**
- **Duplication:** Same information in multiple places
- **Unclear Ownership:** Which is source of truth? (current vs system-reference)
- **Update Burden:** Changes need to be made in multiple places
- **Confusion:** Users don't know which docs to trust

**Recommended Structure:**
```
docs/
├── system-reference/     ✅ DEFINITIVE BASELINE (keep as-is)
├── guides/               ✅ User guides (keep as-is)
├── ux/                   ✅ UX improvements (keep as-is)
└── archive/              ✅ Archived docs (keep as-is)
    ├── architecture/     ← MOVE HERE
    ├── current/          ← MOVE HERE (except policies/)
    └── upgrades/         ← MOVE HERE
```

---

### **4. Systemic Risks Identified**

**Documentation Risks:**
- **Conflicting Information:** Different docs might have different API endpoints, versions
- **Outdated Guidance:** Users might follow wrong docs (mainland vs international)
- **Configuration Errors:** Multiple .env examples could lead to wrong setup

**Code Risks (to investigate with Kimi):**
- Scripts using wrong endpoints (mainland vs international)
- Hardcoded API URLs that don't match design intent
- Legacy code not aligned with manager-first architecture
- References to `zhipuai` SDK (mainland China) instead of `zai-sdk` (international)
- References to `open.bigmodel.cn` endpoints instead of `api.z.ai`

---

## 🎯 KIMI AUDIT STRATEGY

### **Phase 1: Upload Design Intent Baseline**

**Upload to Kimi:**
```
docs/system-reference/
├── README.md                           (313 lines)
├── 01-system-overview.md               (384 lines)
├── 02-provider-architecture.md
├── 03-tool-ecosystem.md
├── 04-features-and-capabilities.md
├── 05-api-endpoints-reference.md
├── 06-deployment-guide.md
└── 07-upgrade-roadmap.md
```

**Total:** 8 files (~2,500-3,000 lines estimated)

**Prompt for Kimi:**
```
This is the DEFINITIVE DESIGN INTENT BASELINE for the EX-AI-MCP-Server project.

Key Design Principles:
- Target: International users using api.z.ai (NOT mainland China)
- Architecture: Manager-first agentic routing
- Providers: GLM (zai-sdk v0.0.4, GLM-4.6) + Kimi (Moonshot API)
- Protocol: WebSocket MCP daemon on ws://127.0.0.1:8765
- Tools: Simple tools + workflow tools with agentic enhancements

Please memorize this baseline. I will upload the entire codebase next,
and you will audit it against this design intent to identify:
1. Code/docs that ALIGN with design intent (keep)
2. Code/docs that CONFLICT with design intent (remove/adjust)
3. Code/docs that are REDUNDANT (consolidate)
4. Missing implementations (gaps to fill)
```

---

### **Phase 2: Upload Entire Codebase**

**Upload Order:**
1. **Core Code** (tools/, src/, utils/)
2. **Scripts** (scripts/)
3. **Other Docs** (docs/current/, docs/architecture/, docs/upgrades/)
4. **Configuration** (.env.example, config files)

**Batch Size:** 20 files per batch (optimized from Phase 3 learnings)

---

### **Phase 3: Kimi Audit Questions**

**For Each Batch, Ask Kimi:**

```
Based on the design intent baseline (docs/system-reference/), audit these files:

1. **Alignment Check:**
   - Does this code/doc align with the design intent?
   - Target audience: International users (api.z.ai) - any mainland China references?
   - Architecture: Manager-first routing - does code follow this pattern?
   - Providers: zai-sdk v0.0.4 + Kimi - any wrong SDKs/endpoints?

2. **Redundancy Check:**
   - Does this duplicate content in system-reference/?
   - Should it be merged, archived, or kept separate?

3. **Conflict Check:**
   - Does this contradict the design intent?
   - Wrong endpoints (open.bigmodel.cn vs api.z.ai)?
   - Wrong SDKs (zhipuai vs zai-sdk)?
   - Legacy patterns not aligned with current architecture?

4. **Action Recommendation:**
   - KEEP (aligns with design)
   - ADJUST (needs modification to align)
   - REMOVE (conflicts or redundant)
   - ARCHIVE (historical, no longer relevant)

Provide specific file-level recommendations with reasoning.
```

---

### **Phase 4: Consolidation Plan**

**Based on Kimi's Audit, Create:**

1. **DELETE_LIST.md** - Files to remove (conflicts, redundant)
2. **ARCHIVE_LIST.md** - Files to archive (historical)
3. **ADJUST_LIST.md** - Files needing modification (with specific changes)
4. **KEEP_LIST.md** - Files that align perfectly
5. **GAPS_LIST.md** - Missing implementations
