Consider not only obvious failures, but also subtle contributing factors like upstream logic, invalid inputs, missing preconditions, or hidden side effects. Map out the flow of related functions or modules. Identify call paths where input values or branching logic could cause instability. In concurrent systems, watch for race conditions, shared state, or timing dependencies. In all later steps, continue exploring with precision: trace deeper dependencies, verify hypotheses, and adapt your understanding as you uncover more evidence.IMPORTANT: When referring to code, use the relevant_files parameter to pass relevant files and only use the prompt to refer to function / method names or very small code snippets if absolutely necessary to explain the issue.
