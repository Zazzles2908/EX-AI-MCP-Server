# Implementation Checklist for Production Readiness

This checklist outlines the necessary steps to ensure the EX-AI MCP Server is fully production-ready.

## Phase 1: Hardening and Bug Fixes

- [ ] **Robust Error Handling:** Implement specific exception handling in `server.py` and other critical components.
- [ ] **Configuration Validation:** Add a startup check to validate all required environment variables and configurations.
- [ ] **Dependency Pinning:** Pin all production dependencies in `requirements.txt` to specific versions.
- [ ] **Resolve Tool Bugs:** Address all issues identified in the Abacus Review document.

## Phase 2: Testing and Quality Assurance

- [ ] **Unit Test Coverage:** Increase unit test coverage to at least 90%, especially for core logic and error paths.
- [ ] **Integration Testing:** Develop a comprehensive integration test suite that simulates real-world MCP interactions.
- [ ] **Load Testing:** Perform load testing to identify performance bottlenecks and ensure stability under high traffic.
- [ ] **Security Audit:** Conduct a thorough security audit, focusing on input validation, authentication, and potential injection vectors.

## Phase 3: Deployment and Operations

- [ ] **Containerization:** Create a Dockerfile for consistent deployment.
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- [ ] **Monitoring and Alerting:** Integrate with a monitoring solution (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for real-time metrics and alerting.
- [ ] **Logging:** Implement structured logging (e.g., JSON format) and centralize logs for easier analysis.
- [ ] **Documentation:** Update all documentation, including deployment guides and API references.
