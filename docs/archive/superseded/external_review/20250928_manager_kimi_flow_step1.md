I understand the workflow you've outlined. You want to:

1. Use Kimi for file upload and extraction
2. Keep GLM-4.5-x for reasoning and summarization
3. Provide an excerpt from the extracted content next

I'm ready to receive the extracted content from you. Once you provide it, I'll help you summarize it using the GLM-4.5-x model while maintaining the conversation thread.

Please go ahead and share the extracted content when you're ready.
