# EXAI-WS MCP Raw Output – Streamlined Server Assessment

Date: 2025-09-27

Attempted tool: thinkdeep_EXAI-WS / chat_EXAI-WS (WS)

Result: FAILED to obtain raw MCP output – WS daemon unreachable.

Error:
```
Failed to connect to WS daemon at ws://127.0.0.1:8765 within 30.0s: [WinError 1225] The remote computer refused the network connection
```

Context sent (intended):
- Files: exai_analysis_report.md, exai_streamlined_implementation_guide.md, exai_cleanup_instructions.md, .env.production
- PR: https://github.com/Zazzles2908/EX-AI-MCP-Server/pull/6
- Task: Assess readiness, risks, and alignment; produce structured summary

Next steps to capture MCP output:
1) Start the EXAI MCP WS daemon (per your environment preference) or configure the EXAI-WS tool to a running endpoint.
2) Re-run the chat_EXAI-WS call with the same parameters to capture the real model output.

Note: This file exists to preserve the attempted MCP call and error details for traceability, per user preference to always capture raw MCP outputs.
