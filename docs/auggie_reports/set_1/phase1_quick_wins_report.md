## EXAI Tool Usage Summary
| Tool | Model | Continuation ID | Purpose | Duration |
|------|-------|----------------|---------|----------|
| None | N/A | N/A | Phase 1 was simple text replacement | N/A |

**Note:** Phase 1 tasks were straightforward text replacements that did not require EXAI tool assistance. Future phases will utilize EXAI tools extensively.

## Validation Results
- **Tests Run:** None (autonomous execution mode)
- **Tests Passed:** N/A
- **Tests Failed:** N/A
- **Server Status:** Not tested (no server restart performed)
- **Smoke Tests:** Not performed
- **Search Results:** 3 CRITICAL references fixed, 19 additional references documented

## Files Modified
| File | Before (lines) | After (lines) | Change | Status |
|------|---------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| tools/shared/base_tool_core.py | 281 | 281 | 2 refs fixed | ✅ |
| run-server.ps1 | 1961 | 1961 | 1 ref fixed | ✅ |

## Continuation ID Tracking
- **GLM Family:** None used in Phase 1
- **Kimi Family:** None used in Phase 1

**Note:** Phase 1 did not require EXAI tools. Continuation ID tracking will begin in Phase 2.

## Additional Findings

### Discovered Additional "Zen" References (19 total)
These references were not part of the original CRITICAL priority list but were discovered during verification:

**Documentation/Comments:**
1. tools/capabilities/recommend.py - Line 1: "RecommendTool - Intelligent tool and model recommendation for Zen MCP"
2. tools/capabilities/recommend.py - Line 2: "Analyze user prompt (and optional files) to recommend the best Zen tool"
3. tools/capabilities/recommend.py - Line 3: "INTELLIGENT TOOL RECOMMENDATIONS - Suggests the best Zen tool(s)"
4. tools/registry.py - Line 1: "Lean Tool Registry for Zen MCP"
5. tools/shared/base_tool.py - Line 1: "Abstract base class for all Zen MCP tools"
6. tools/shared/base_tool_file_handling.py - Line 1: "File Handling Mixin for Zen MCP Tools"
7. tools/shared/base_tool_model_management.py - Line 1: "Model Management Mixin for Zen MCP Tools"
8. tools/shared/base_tool_response.py - Line 1: "Response Formatting Mixin for Zen MCP Tools"
9. tools/simple/__init__.py - Line 1: "Simple tools for Zen MCP"
10. tools/workflow/workflow_mixin.py - Line 1: "Workflow Mixin for Zen MCP Tools"
11. tools/workflow/__init__.py - Line 1: "Workflow tools for Zen MCP"

**URLs/Paths:**
12. tools/capabilities/version.py - GitHub URL: "zen-mcp-server"
13. tools/selfcheck.py - Log path: "zen-mcp-server"
14. tools/version.py - GitHub URL: "zen-mcp-server"

**PowerShell Script:**
15-19. run-server.ps1 - Multiple references in comments and documentation

**Recommendation:** Create a Phase 5 task to systematically replace all remaining "zen" references with "exai" for complete brand consistency.

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Simple text replacement** was efficient for CRITICAL references
2. **Task list structure** provided clear progress tracking
3. **Autonomous execution** worked smoothly without user input
4. **Verification step** discovered additional scope

### What Didn't Work
1. **Incomplete audit** - Original audit missed 19 additional references
2. **No server testing** - Unable to verify server functionality in autonomous mode

### Adjustments Made
1. **Documented additional findings** for future phases
2. **Recommended Phase 5** for complete "zen" cleanup

### Recommendations for Next Phase
1. **Use EXAI tools** for complex refactoring in Phase 2
2. **Plan for testing** - Consider how to validate server functionality
3. **Expand scope** - Consider adding Phase 5 for complete "zen" cleanup
4. **Git commits** - Ensure git commits are made before Phase 2 begins

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. ✅ Phase 1 complete - All 3 CRITICAL references fixed
2. ⏳ Review this report
3. ⏳ Consider expanding scope to fix all 19 additional "zen" references
4. ⏳ Prepare for Phase 2: Critical File Bloat

### Preparation for Phase 2
1. **Git Commit:** Commit Phase 1 changes before starting Phase 2
2. **Baseline Tests:** Run test suite to establish baseline
3. **EXAI Tools:** Prepare to use analyze_exai, refactor_exai, codereview_exai
4. **Continuation IDs:** Begin tracking GLM and Kimi conversation IDs
5. **Time Allocation:** Phase 2 estimated 24-36 hours

### Outstanding Issues to Address
1. **Additional "zen" references:** 19 references discovered, not yet fixed
2. **Server validation:** Server functionality not tested in autonomous mode
3. **Test suite:** Need to establish baseline test results before Phase 2
