# EXPERT VALIDATION TIMEOUT FIX - 2025-10-04

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Session:** Autonomous Phase 4 - Expert Validation Verification  
**Agent:** Autonomous Phase 4 Agent (Claude Sonnet 4.5)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ TIMEOUT ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

---

## üéØ ISSUE DISCOVERED

After fixing the Python MRO bug (stub method shadowing real implementation), expert validation started working but caused **36+ minute timeouts** (2200+ seconds), making the system unusable.

**Symptoms:**
- Tool calls taking 2200+ seconds to complete
- WebSocket daemon timing out
- "Daemon did not return call_tool_res in time" errors
- System appearing to hang/glitch

---

## üîç ROOT CAUSE: TIMEOUT MISMATCH

**The Problem:**
- **WebSocket daemon timeout:** `EXAI_WS_CALL_TIMEOUT=180` seconds (3 minutes)
- **Expert analysis timeout:** `EXPERT_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_SECS` defaults to **300 seconds** (5 minutes)
- **Result:** Expert analysis tries to run for 5 minutes, but WebSocket daemon kills it after 3 minutes, causing timeout errors and retries

**Why This Happened:**
1. The MRO fix made expert validation actually work (good!)
2. Expert validation started making real provider API calls (good!)
3. But the default timeout (300s) exceeded the WebSocket timeout (180s) (bad!)
4. The WebSocket daemon would timeout before expert analysis completed
5. This caused the system to hang or retry indefinitely

---

## ‚úÖ THE FIX

**Added to `.env` (lines 12-15):**
```bash
# Expert analysis timeout must be LESS than EXAI_WS_CALL_TIMEOUT (180s)
# to prevent WebSocket daemon timeouts. Setting to 90s provides safe buffer.
EXPERT_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_SECS=90
EXPERT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECS=5
```

**Added to `.env.example` (lines 18-28):**
```bash
# EXPERT_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_SECS: Maximum time for expert analysis provider calls
# CRITICAL: Must be LESS than EXAI_WS_CALL_TIMEOUT to prevent daemon timeouts
# Default: 300 seconds (5 minutes) - but should be set to 90s for production
# Recommended: 90 seconds (provides safe buffer under 180s WebSocket timeout)
EXPERT_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_SECS=90

# EXPERT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECS: How often to emit progress during expert analysis
# Default: 10 seconds - but should be set to 5s to keep WebSocket connection alive
# Recommended: 5 seconds (prevents idle timeout disconnects)
EXPERT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECS=5
```

**Why These Values:**
- **90 seconds** for expert analysis: Provides 90-second buffer under the 180-second WebSocket timeout
- **5 seconds** for heartbeat: Keeps WebSocket connection alive and provides progress feedback

---

## üìä TIMEOUT HIERARCHY

**Correct Timeout Ordering (from shortest to longest):**

1. **Heartbeat Interval:** 5 seconds
   - How often to emit progress during expert analysis
   - Keeps WebSocket connection alive
   - Provides user feedback

2. **Expert Analysis Timeout:** 90 seconds
   - Maximum time for expert analysis provider call
   - Must complete before WebSocket timeout
   - Includes buffer for network latency

3. **WebSocket Call Timeout:** 180 seconds (3 minutes)
   - Hard ceiling for entire tool invocation
   - Enforced by WebSocket daemon
   - Cannot be exceeded

**Formula:** `EXPERT_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_SECS + buffer < EXAI_WS_CALL_TIMEOUT`

**Safe Configuration:** `90 + 90 = 180` ‚úÖ

---

## üî¨ VERIFICATION REQUIRED

**Critical Next Step:** üî¥ **SERVER MUST BE RESTARTED** for timeout changes to take effect!

**After restart, test with:**

```python
debug_exai(
    step="Verify expert validation with proper timeouts",
    step_number=1,
    total_steps=2,
    next_step_required=true,
    findings="Testing expert validation after timeout fix",
    hypothesis="Expert validation should complete within 90 seconds",
    confidence="low",
    use_assistant_model=true
)
```

Then continue with step 2:

```python
debug_exai(
    step="Complete verification",
    step_number=2,
    total_steps=2,
    next_step_required=false,
    findings="Completed verification test",
    hypothesis="Expert analysis should complete successfully",
    confidence="high",
    continuation_id="<from_step_1>",
    use_assistant_model=true
)
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Tool completes within 90-120 seconds (not 2200+ seconds)
- ‚úÖ expert_analysis contains real content (not null)
- ‚úÖ No WebSocket daemon timeout errors
- ‚úÖ No "Daemon did not return call_tool_res in time" errors
- ‚úÖ Progress heartbeats visible during expert analysis

## üìÅ FILES MODIFIED

1. **`.env`** - Added EXPERT_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_SECS=90 and EXPERT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECS=5
2. **`.env.example`** - Added comprehensive documentation for timeout configuration

---

## üéì LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Always check timeout hierarchies** - Ensure inner timeouts are less than outer timeouts
2. **Default values can be dangerous** - The 300-second default was too high for production
3. **Test with real provider calls** - The MRO fix revealed the timeout issue
4. **Document timeout relationships** - Make it clear which timeouts must be coordinated
5. **Provide safe defaults** - 90 seconds is a better default than 300 seconds

---

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

1. **Restart MCP server** to load timeout configuration
2. **Test expert validation** with debug_exai (should complete in 90-120 seconds)
3. **Verify all workflow tools** work with new timeouts
4. **Monitor actual durations** to ensure 90 seconds is sufficient
5. **Adjust if needed** - If 90 seconds is too short, increase to 120 seconds (still under 180s limit)

## üîó RELATED ISSUES

**Issue 1: Python MRO Bug (FIXED)**
- Stub method in ConversationIntegrationMixin shadowing real implementation
- Fixed by removing stub method
- See: `EXPERT_VALIDATION_ROOT_CAUSE_FOUND_2025-10-04.md`

**Issue 2: Timeout Mismatch (FIXED)**
- Expert analysis timeout (300s) exceeding WebSocket timeout (180s)
- Fixed by setting EXPERT_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_SECS=90
- This document

**Issue 3: Verification Pending**
- Need to restart server and test that expert validation works with proper timeouts
- Expected to be resolved after restart

**Timeout Fix Implemented:** 2025-10-04  
**Verification:** Pending server restart  
**Confidence Level:** VERY HIGH - Timeout configuration is correct

**Expert validation should now work correctly with reasonable timeouts!** üéâ
