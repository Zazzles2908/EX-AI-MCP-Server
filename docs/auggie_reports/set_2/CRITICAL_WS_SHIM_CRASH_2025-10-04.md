# CRITICAL: WebSocket Shim Crashing - No Tool Calls Reaching Daemon

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL - SYSTEM BROKEN  
**Priority:** P0 - BLOCKING ALL FUNCTIONALITY

---

## üö® THE PROBLEM

**Symptom:** When ExAI tools are called (thinkdeep_exai, chat_exai, etc.), no logs are generated and the tool call returns `<error>Cancelled by user.</error>`

**Root Cause:** The WebSocket shim (`run_ws_shim.py`) is crashing with `anyio.ClosedResourceError` when trying to send responses back to Auggie CLI.

---

## üîç INVESTIGATION FINDINGS

### Error Stack Trace

**File:** `logs/ws_shim.log` (last error at 18:04:49)

```
anyio.ClosedResourceError
  File "mcp/shared/session.py", line 329, in _send_response
    await self._write_stream.send(session_message)
  File "anyio/streams/memory.py", line 212, in send_nowait
    raise ClosedResourceError
```

**What This Means:**
- The MCP server is trying to send a response back to Auggie CLI
- But the write stream has already been closed
- This causes the entire task group to crash with an ExceptionGroup
- The tool call never completes

---

### Timeline of Events

1. **Auggie CLI calls tool** (e.g., thinkdeep_exai)
2. **MCP shim receives request** via stdio
3. **MCP shim processes request** (gets to `_handle_request`)
4. **MCP shim tries to send response** via `message.respond(response)`
5. **Stream is already closed** - `ClosedResourceError` raised
6. **Task group crashes** - ExceptionGroup propagates
7. **Shim exits** - No response sent to Auggie CLI
8. **Auggie CLI sees cancellation** - Returns `<error>Cancelled by user.</error>`

---

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Hypothesis 1: Schema Validation Error Causing Early Disconnect

**Evidence:**
- Schema validation warning on Auggie CLI startup: "strict mode: use allowUnionTypes"
- This warning appears BEFORE any tool calls
- Auggie CLI might be rejecting the connection due to invalid schema

**Test:**
- We fixed the schema in `glm_payload_preview.py`
- But daemon was restarted, shim was NOT restarted
- Auggie CLI might still be seeing the old schema

**Action Required:**
- Restart Auggie CLI to pick up schema fix
- Verify no schema validation warnings on startup

---

### Hypothesis 2: Timeout on Auggie CLI Side

**Evidence:**
- `EXAI_SHIM_RPC_TIMEOUT=150` in mcp-config.auggie.json
- Tool calls might be taking longer than 150 seconds
- Auggie CLI closes connection after timeout

**Test:**
- Check if tool calls are taking > 150 seconds
- Increase timeout if needed

**Action Required:**
- Monitor tool call duration
- Increase `EXAI_SHIM_RPC_TIMEOUT` if needed (e.g., to 300)

---

### Hypothesis 3: MCP Protocol Version Mismatch

**Evidence:**
- Using Python 3.13 (very new)
- MCP SDK might have compatibility issues
- anyio/asyncio behavior might have changed

**Test:**
- Check MCP SDK version
- Check for known issues with Python 3.13

**Action Required:**
- Review MCP SDK compatibility
- Consider downgrading to Python 3.11 or 3.12 if needed

---

### Hypothesis 4: Stream Closing Race Condition

**Evidence:**
- Error occurs in `_send_response` after request processing
- Stream might be closing while response is being sent
- This could be a timing issue in the MCP SDK

**Test:**
- Add error handling around stream.send()
- Log when stream closes

**Action Required:**
- Add try/except around stream operations
- Log stream state before sending

---

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE FIXES TO TRY

### Fix 1: Restart Auggie CLI (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Why:** Schema fix was applied, but Auggie CLI hasn't reloaded

**Action:**
1. Close Auggie CLI completely
2. Reopen Auggie CLI
3. Verify no schema validation warnings on startup
4. Test tool call again

**Expected Result:**
- No schema validation warnings
- Tool calls should work

---

### Fix 2: Increase RPC Timeout

**Why:** 150 seconds might not be enough for some tool calls

**Action:**
Update `mcp-config.auggie.json`:
```json
"env": {
  "EXAI_SHIM_RPC_TIMEOUT": "300",  // Increase from 150 to 300
  ...
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Longer timeout allows tool calls to complete
- Reduces chance of premature disconnection

---

### Fix 3: Add Error Handling to Shim

**Why:** Prevent crashes when stream closes unexpectedly

**Action:**
Modify `run_ws_shim.py` to catch `ClosedResourceError`:

```python
@server.call_tool()
async def handle_call_tool(name: str, arguments: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[TextContent]:
    try:
        # ... existing code ...
    except anyio.ClosedResourceError as e:
        logger.error(f"Stream closed while sending response: {e}")
        # Return error response instead of crashing
        return [TextContent(type="text", text=f"Error: Stream closed unexpectedly")]
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception(f"Unexpected error in handle_call_tool: {e}")
        raise
```

**Expected Result:**
- Shim doesn't crash on stream errors
- Returns error message instead of silent failure

---

## üìä VERIFICATION STEPS

### Step 1: Check Current State

```bash
# Check if daemon is running
tail -10 logs/ws_daemon.log

# Check if shim is crashing
tail -50 logs/ws_shim.log | grep "ERROR\|ClosedResourceError"

# Check daemon health
cat logs/ws_daemon.health.json
```

### Step 2: Restart Auggie CLI

1. Close Auggie CLI
2. Reopen Auggie CLI
3. Check for schema validation warnings
4. Test simple tool call (e.g., `listmodels_exai()`)

### Step 3: Test Tool Calls

```python
# Test 1: Simple tool (should be fast)
listmodels_exai()

# Test 2: Chat tool (moderate complexity)
chat_exai(prompt="Hello, how are you?", use_websearch=false, model="glm-4.5-flash")

# Test 3: Thinkdeep (complex, might be slow)
thinkdeep_exai(
    step="Analyze the project",
    step_number=1,
    total_steps=1,
    next_step_required=false,
    findings="Test",
    confidence="high",
    model="glm-4.5-flash"
)
```

### Step 4: Monitor Logs

```bash
# Watch shim logs in real-time
tail -f logs/ws_shim.log

# Watch daemon logs in real-time
tail -f logs/ws_daemon.log
```
