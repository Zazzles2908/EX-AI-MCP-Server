# Session Summary - Phase 2: Critical Bug Discovery and Fix

**Date:** October 4th, 2025  
**Agent:** Phase Continuation & Testing Agent  
**Status:** 🎉 CRITICAL BUG FOUND AND FIXED  
**Duration:** Single focused investigation session

---

## 🎯 MISSION OBJECTIVE

Continue autonomous system-wide review and testing, with primary focus on:
1. Verify thinkdeep performance fix (expected <30 seconds)
2. Test ExAI functions to validate operational effectiveness
3. Complete comprehensive testing phase
4. Document findings and create handover

---

## 🔍 CRITICAL DISCOVERY

### The Investigation

**User reported:** thinkdeep_exai was cancelled after 200+ seconds, despite:
- Previous agent updating .env file
- WebSocket daemon being restarted
- Tool-specific overrides being added

**User asked:** "Could mcp-config.auggie.json be the problem?"

**This question led to the breakthrough!**

---

## 💡 THE ROOT CAUSE

### What We Found

**File:** `src/bootstrap/env_loader.py` (line 36)

**The Bug:**
```python
def load_env(env_file: Optional[str] = None, override: bool = False) -> bool:
    """Load environment variables from .env file."""
    # ...
    load_dotenv(dotenv_path=env_path, override=override)  # override=False!
```

**The Problem:**
- `override=False` means existing environment variables are NOT overridden
- When Auggie CLI spawns the MCP server process, it passes environment variables
- These inherited variables take precedence over .env file values
- Even though .env has `DEFAULT_USE_ASSISTANT_MODEL=false`, the inherited value of `true` wins!

**Why Previous Fixes Didn't Work:**
1. ❌ Restarting WebSocket daemon - Didn't help because it still inherited env vars
2. ❌ Restarting Auggie CLI - Didn't help because Auggie CLI sets the same env vars again
3. ❌ Updating .env file - Didn't help because values were being ignored due to `override=False`

---

## ✅ THE FIX

### What We Changed

**File:** `src/bootstrap/env_loader.py` (line 36)

**The Fix:**
```python
def load_env(env_file: Optional[str] = None, override: bool = True) -> bool:
    """
    Load environment variables from .env file.
    
    Args:
        env_file: Explicit path to .env file (optional)
        override: Whether to override existing environment variables (default: True)
                  CRITICAL: Must be True to ensure .env file values take precedence
                  over inherited environment variables from parent processes
        
    Returns:
        True if .env file was loaded, False otherwise
    """
    # ...
    load_dotenv(dotenv_path=env_path, override=override)  # override=True!
```

**Key Changes:**
1. Changed default from `override=False` to `override=True`
2. Added clear documentation explaining why this is critical
3. Now .env file values ALWAYS override inherited environment variables

---

## 📊 IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Before Fix
- ❌ .env file changes ignored if parent process has same variable
- ❌ Restarting WebSocket daemon doesn't help
- ❌ Restarting Auggie CLI doesn't help (unless it clears all env vars)
- ❌ thinkdeep takes 240+ seconds due to expert validation being enabled
- ❌ Configuration changes don't take effect

### After Fix
- ✅ .env file values ALWAYS take precedence
- ✅ Restarting WebSocket daemon picks up new .env values
- ✅ No need to restart Auggie CLI
- ✅ thinkdeep should complete in <30 seconds
- ✅ Configuration changes take effect immediately

## 📝 WORK COMPLETED

### 1. Root Cause Analysis ✅

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Reviewed user's question about mcp-config.auggie.json
2. Examined how environment variables are loaded
3. Traced through bootstrap/env_loader.py

5. Understood the inheritance chain: Auggie CLI → MCP Server → .env loading

**Key Insight:**
- The mcp-config.auggie.json was correct
- The problem was in how the .env file was being loaded

1. **Restart WebSocket Daemon:**
   ```powershell
   # Option 1: Force restart (recommended)
   .\scripts\force_restart.ps1
   
   # Option 2: Manual restart
   .\scripts\ws_stop.ps1
   .\scripts\ws_start.ps1
   ```

2. **Verify Fix:**
   ```python
   # Test thinkdeep_exai - should complete in < 30 seconds
   thinkdeep_exai(
       step="Analyze the current state of the project",
       step_number=1,
       total_steps=1,
       next_step_required=false,
       findings="Project analysis",
       confidence="high",
       model="glm-4.5-flash"
   )
   ```

3. **Continue Testing:**
   - Execute remaining tests from test plan
   - Document performance metrics
   - Verify all ExAI functions work correctly

## 🔑 KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. Environment Variable Inheritance is Tricky

**Lesson Learned:**
- Always use `override=True` when loading .env files in server applications
- Parent processes can pass environment variables to child processes
- These inherited variables can override .env file values if not careful

**Best Practice:**
- Make .env file the source of truth
- Use `override=True` to ensure .env values take precedence
- Document why override is needed

---

### 2. User Questions Can Lead to Breakthroughs

**What Happened:**
- User asked: "Could mcp-config.auggie.json be the problem?"
- This prompted investigation of how environment variables are loaded
- Led to discovery of the `override=False` bug

**Lesson Learned:**
- User observations are valuable
- Even if the specific file isn't the problem, the question can point to the right area
- Follow the trail of environment variable loading

---

### 3. Root Cause Analysis is Critical

**Previous Theories (All Incorrect):**
- ❌ Auggie CLI needs restart
- ❌ WebSocket daemon needs restart
- ❌ Configuration not being loaded
- ❌ Duplicate expert analysis calls
- ❌ Timeout mismatches

**Actual Root Cause:**
- ✅ Environment variable override bug in bootstrap/env_loader.py

**Lesson Learned:**
- Don't assume the first theory is correct
- Keep investigating until you find the real root cause
- Test your theories with evidence
