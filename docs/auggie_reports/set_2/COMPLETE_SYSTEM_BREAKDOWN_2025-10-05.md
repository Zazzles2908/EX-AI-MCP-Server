# COMPLETE SYSTEM BREAKDOWN - What's Actually Broken

**Date:** 2025-10-05 00:15  
**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL - System is fundamentally broken  
**Purpose:** Complete honest assessment of what's working and what's not

---

## üéØ THE BRUTAL TRUTH

**User is 100% correct:** The tools don't work, logging is broken, and we've been going in circles.

**What I found:**
1. ‚ùå Tools hang for minutes and do nothing
2. ‚ùå Daemon logs show ONLY startup messages - no tool execution
3. ‚ùå ws_shim.log shows `ClosedResourceError` - streams closing prematurely
4. ‚ùå No actual logging of tool calls or execution
5. ‚ùå The "fixes" I implemented don't address the root cause

---

## üîç ACTUAL LOG ANALYSIS

### ws_daemon.log - ONLY STARTUP MESSAGES

```
2025-10-04 12:33:16 INFO ws_daemon: Starting WS daemon on ws://127.0.0.1:8765
2025-10-04 12:38:19 INFO ws_daemon: Starting WS daemon on ws://127.0.0.1:8765
2025-10-04 12:44:35 INFO ws_daemon: Starting WS daemon on ws://127.0.0.1:8765
... (26 restarts in one day)
2025-10-04 22:32:34 INFO ws_daemon: Starting WS daemon on ws://127.0.0.1:8765
```

**What's Missing:**
- ‚ùå No "Tool call received" messages
- ‚ùå No "Executing tool X" messages
- ‚ùå No "Tool completed in Y seconds" messages
- ‚ùå No error messages
- ‚ùå No debug information

**Conclusion:** The daemon is NOT logging tool execution at all!

---

### ws_shim.log - STREAM CLOSING ERRORS

```
anyio.ClosedResourceError
  File "mcp/shared/session.py", line 329, in _send_response
    await self._write_stream.send(session_message)
  File "anyio/streams/memory.py", line 212, in send_nowait
    raise ClosedResourceError
```

**What This Means:**
- The MCP shim receives a tool call
- It tries to send a response back
- But the stream has already been closed
- So the response never reaches the client
- The client (Auggie CLI) waits forever

**Root Cause:** The MCP protocol layer is closing streams prematurely

---

### ws_daemon.metrics.jsonl - ONLY SHOWS SUCCESSFUL CALLS

```json
{"t": 1759565687.49, "op": "call_tool", "lat": 0.003, "name": "listmodels"}
{"t": 1759565718.31, "op": "call_tool", "lat": 21.83, "name": "chat", "prov": "GLM"}
{"t": 1759578933.31, "op": "call_tool", "lat": 7.008, "name": "thinkdeep"}
```

**What This Shows:**
- Some tools DO complete successfully
- listmodels: 0.003s
- chat: 21.8s
- thinkdeep: 7.0s

**But:** These are only the successful calls. Failed calls don't appear here.

---

## üèóÔ∏è HOW THE SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO WORK

### The Intended Architecture

```
User (Auggie CLI)
    ‚Üì MCP Protocol
run_ws_shim.py (MCP Server)
    ‚Üì WebSocket
ws_server.py (WebSocket Daemon)
    ‚Üì Direct Call
Tool Implementation (thinkdeep.py, debug.py, etc.)
    ‚Üì Provider Call
AI Provider (GLM, Kimi, etc.)
    ‚Üì Response
Back up the chain to User
```

### What Should Happen (Step by Step)

1. **User calls tool in Auggie CLI:**
   ```python
   thinkdeep_exai(step="Analyze", ...)
   ```

2. **Auggie CLI sends MCP request to run_ws_shim.py:**
   ```json
   {"method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "thinkdeep", "arguments": {...}}}
   ```

3. **run_ws_shim.py receives MCP request:**
   - Checks daemon health
   - Connects to WebSocket daemon
   - Sends WebSocket message

4. **ws_server.py receives WebSocket message:**
   - Validates session
   - Looks up tool in registry
   - Calls tool implementation

5. **Tool executes:**
   - Processes request
   - Calls AI provider
   - Returns result

6. **ws_server.py sends response back:**
   - Formats response
   - Sends via WebSocket

7. **run_ws_shim.py receives WebSocket response:**
   - Converts to MCP response
   - Sends back to Auggie CLI

8. **Auggie CLI displays result to user**

---

## üö® WHAT'S ACTUALLY BROKEN

### Problem 1: Stream Closing Prematurely ‚ùå

**Location:** `mcp/shared/session.py` (MCP SDK)

**Issue:**
- The MCP write stream closes before the response is sent
- This causes `ClosedResourceError`
- The response never reaches Auggie CLI
- Auggie CLI waits forever (or until user cancels)

**Why This Happens:**
- Timeout on Auggie CLI side
- MCP protocol version mismatch
- Python 3.13 compatibility issues with anyio
- Race condition in stream handling

**Evidence:**
```
anyio.ClosedResourceError
  File "mcp/shared/session.py", line 329, in _send_response
    await self._write_stream.send(session_message)
```

---

### Problem 2: No Tool Execution Logging ‚ùå

**Location:** `src/daemon/ws_server.py`

**Issue:**
- The daemon logs ONLY startup messages
- No logging when tools are called
- No logging during tool execution
- No logging when tools complete
- No error logging

**Why This Happens:**
- Logging is not implemented in the tool execution path
- Only startup logging exists
- Tool calls go through silently

**What's Missing:**
```python
# Should have but doesn't:
logger.info(f"Received tool call: {tool_name}")
logger.info(f"Executing tool: {tool_name} with args: {args}")
logger.info(f"Tool {tool_name} completed in {duration}s")
logger.error(f"Tool {tool_name} failed: {error}")
```

---

### Problem 3: Workflow Tools Hang ‚ùå

**Location:** `tools/workflow/` (thinkdeep, debug, analyze, etc.)

**Issue:**
- Workflow tools take minutes and do nothing
- No progress updates visible
- No way to know if they're working or stuck
- User has to cancel after waiting

**Why This Happens:**
- Progress messages are sent but not visible
- MCP stream closes before progress can be sent
- Long-running operations have no timeout
- No heartbeat mechanism that actually works

**Evidence:**
- User reports: "you just watch for minutes and do nothing"
- thinkdeep metrics show 7s completion, but user sees 384s hang
- This means the tool completes but response never reaches user

---

### Problem 4: Metrics Don't Show Failures ‚ùå

**Location:** `logs/ws_daemon.metrics.jsonl`

**Issue:**
- Metrics only show successful tool calls
- Failed calls don't appear
- No way to diagnose what went wrong
- Gives false impression that tools are working

**Why This Happens:**
- Metrics are only written on successful completion
- Failed calls don't reach the metrics logging code
- Stream closes before metrics can be written

---

## üîß WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED

### Fix 1: Add Comprehensive Logging (CRITICAL)

**Where:** `src/daemon/ws_server.py`

**What to Add:**
```python
async def handle_tool_call(self, session_id, tool_name, arguments):
    logger.info(f"[{session_id}] Received tool call: {tool_name}")
    logger.debug(f"[{session_id}] Arguments: {json.dumps(arguments, indent=2)}")
    
    start_time = time.time()
    try:
        logger.info(f"[{session_id}] Executing tool: {tool_name}")
        result = await self.execute_tool(tool_name, arguments)
        duration = time.time() - start_time
        logger.info(f"[{session_id}] Tool {tool_name} completed in {duration:.2f}s")
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        duration = time.time() - start_time
        logger.error(f"[{session_id}] Tool {tool_name} failed after {duration:.2f}s: {e}")
        logger.exception(f"[{session_id}] Full traceback:")
        raise
```

**Impact:** We can actually see what's happening!

---

### Fix 2: Fix Stream Closing Issue (CRITICAL)

**Where:** `scripts/run_ws_shim.py`

**Options:**

**Option A: Increase Timeouts**
```python
# In mcp-config.auggie.json
"env": {
    "EXAI_SHIM_RPC_TIMEOUT": "600",  # 10 minutes instead of 150s
    "EXAI_WS_CALL_TIMEOUT": "600"
}
```

**Option B: Add Keep-Alive**
```python
# In run_ws_shim.py
async def keep_alive_loop():
    while True:
        await asyncio.sleep(30)
        # Send ping to keep connection alive
        await ws.ping()
```

**Option C: Handle ClosedResourceError Gracefully**
```python
try:
    await message.respond(response)
except anyio.ClosedResourceError:
    logger.error("Stream closed before response could be sent")
    # Try to reconnect and resend
    await reconnect_and_retry(message, response)
```

---

### Fix 3: Add Progress Visibility (HIGH)

**Where:** `tools/workflow/base.py`

**What to Add:**
```python
def send_progress_visible(self, message: str):
    """Send progress that's actually visible to the user"""
    # Log it
    logger.info(f"PROGRESS: {message}")
    
    # Send via WebSocket
    try:
        self.ws_connection.send_progress(message)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to send progress: {e}")
    
    # Write to file (fallback)
    with open("logs/progress.log", "a") as f:
        f.write(f"{time.time()}: {message}\n")
```

---

### Fix 4: Add Failure Logging (HIGH)

**Where:** `src/daemon/ws_server.py`

**What to Add:**
```python
# Log ALL tool calls, success or failure
async def log_tool_call(self, tool_name, arguments, result, error, duration):
    entry = {
        "timestamp": time.time(),
        "tool": tool_name,
        "duration": duration,
        "success": error is None,
        "error": str(error) if error else None
    }
    
    # Write to failures log
    if error:
        with open("logs/tool_failures.jsonl", "a") as f:
            f.write(json.dumps(entry) + "\n")
    
    # Write to all calls log
    with open("logs/tool_calls_all.jsonl", "a") as f:
        f.write(json.dumps(entry) + "\n")
```

---

## üìä CURRENT STATE SUMMARY

### What's Working ‚úÖ

1. **WebSocket Daemon Starts:** Daemon starts successfully
2. **Health Check:** Health file is updated
3. **Some Tools Complete:** listmodels, chat work (when stream doesn't close)
4. **Metrics for Successful Calls:** Successful calls are logged to metrics

### What's Broken ‚ùå

1. **Stream Closes Prematurely:** `ClosedResourceError` kills responses
2. **No Tool Execution Logging:** Can't see what's happening
3. **Workflow Tools Hang:** thinkdeep, debug, etc. appear to do nothing
4. **No Failure Logging:** Failed calls disappear into the void
5. **Progress Not Visible:** Progress messages don't reach user
6. **No Timeout Handling:** Long operations hang forever

---

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE

**The fundamental problem:** The MCP protocol layer (run_ws_shim.py) is closing the response stream before long-running tools can send their responses back.

**Why this happens:**
1. Tool takes 7 seconds to complete (verified in metrics)
2. But Auggie CLI times out after some period
3. Auggie CLI closes the MCP stream
4. Tool tries to send response
5. Stream is already closed ‚Üí `ClosedResourceError`
6. User sees nothing and waits forever

**The vicious cycle:**
1. Tool hangs (from user perspective)
2. User cancels
3. No error logged
4. No way to diagnose
5. Repeat

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN

### Immediate Actions (Priority Order)

1. **Add comprehensive logging** (1-2 hours)
   - Log every tool call received
   - Log tool execution start/end
   - Log all errors with full tracebacks
   - Log progress messages

2. **Fix stream closing issue** (2-4 hours)
   - Increase timeouts in mcp-config.auggie.json
   - Add keep-alive mechanism
   - Handle ClosedResourceError gracefully
   - Add reconnection logic

3. **Add failure tracking** (1 hour)
   - Log all failed tool calls
   - Create tool_failures.jsonl
   - Add failure metrics

4. **Test thoroughly** (2-3 hours)
   - Test each workflow tool
   - Verify logging works
   - Confirm responses reach user
   - Document actual behavior

---

## üìù HONEST ASSESSMENT

**What I did wrong:**
- Focused on documentation instead of root cause
- Assumed tools were working based on metrics
- Didn't check actual logs thoroughly
- Implemented "fixes" that don't address the real problem

**What the real problem is:**
- MCP stream closes before responses can be sent
- No logging to diagnose issues
- No visibility into what's actually happening

**What needs to happen:**
- Add comprehensive logging FIRST
- Then fix the stream closing issue
- Then test everything thoroughly
- Then document what actually works

---

---

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Add Logging (DO THIS FIRST)

**File:** `src/daemon/ws_server.py`

**Add at the beginning of handle_call_tool:**
```python
logger.info(f"=== TOOL CALL START ===")
logger.info(f"Session: {session_id}")
logger.info(f"Tool: {tool_name}")
logger.info(f"Arguments: {json.dumps(arguments, indent=2)[:500]}")  # First 500 chars
logger.info(f"=== EXECUTING ===")
```

**Add at the end of handle_call_tool:**
```python
logger.info(f"=== TOOL CALL COMPLETE ===")
logger.info(f"Tool: {tool_name}")
logger.info(f"Duration: {duration:.2f}s")
logger.info(f"Success: {success}")
if error:
    logger.error(f"Error: {error}")
    logger.exception("Full traceback:")
logger.info(f"=== END ===")
```

### Phase 2: Fix Stream Closing

**File:** `mcp-config.auggie.json`

**Change:**
```json
"env": {
    "EXAI_SHIM_RPC_TIMEOUT": "600",  // 10 minutes
    "EXAI_WS_CALL_TIMEOUT": "600",
    "EXAI_WS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT": "30"
}
```

### Phase 3: Add Failure Tracking

**File:** `src/daemon/ws_server.py`

**Add function:**
```python
def log_tool_failure(tool_name, error, duration):
    with open("logs/tool_failures.jsonl", "a") as f:
        f.write(json.dumps({
            "timestamp": time.time(),
            "tool": tool_name,
            "error": str(error),
            "duration": duration
        }) + "\n")
```

### Phase 4: Test Everything

**Test each tool:**
1. listmodels_exai() - should work
2. chat_exai() - should work
3. thinkdeep_exai() - currently hangs
4. debug_exai() - currently hangs
5. codereview_exai() - currently hangs

**Check logs after each test:**
```bash
tail -50 logs/ws_daemon.log
tail -20 logs/tool_failures.jsonl
```

**Status:** HONEST ASSESSMENT COMPLETE
**Next Step:** Implement logging FIRST, then fix stream closing, then test
