## ✅ FIX 1: Daemon Connectivity Error Messages (P0 - CRITICAL)

### Problem
- External AI experienced 30-second timeout with no recovery guidance
- No health check before connection attempt
- No clear error message explaining what to do

### Solution Implemented

**File:** `scripts/run_ws_shim.py`

**Changes:**

1. **Reduced Connection Timeout** (Line 41)
   ```python
   # Before
   EXAI_WS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT = float(os.getenv("EXAI_WS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT", "30"))
   
   # After
   EXAI_WS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT = float(os.getenv("EXAI_WS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT", "10"))  # Reduced from 30s to 10s
   ```

2. **Added Health Check Configuration** (Lines 45-46)
   ```python
   HEALTH_FILE = get_repo_root() / "logs" / "ws_daemon.health.json"
   HEALTH_FRESH_SECS = 20.0  # Health file must be updated within this many seconds
   ```

3. **Implemented Health Check Function** (Lines 69-131)
   ```python
   def _check_daemon_health() -> tuple[bool, str]:
       """
       Check if WebSocket daemon is running and healthy.
       
       Returns:
           tuple[bool, str]: (is_healthy, status_message)
       """
       # Check if health file exists
       if not HEALTH_FILE.exists():
           return False, (
               "WebSocket daemon health file not found.\n"
               "This usually means the daemon is not running.\n"
               "\n"
               "To start the daemon:\n"
               "  Windows: .\\scripts\\force_restart.ps1\n"
               "  Linux/Mac: ./scripts/force_restart.sh\n"
               "\n"
               "To check daemon status:\n"
               "  python scripts/ws/ws_status.py"
           )
       
       # Check if health file is fresh
       health_data = json.loads(HEALTH_FILE.read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
       health_timestamp = float(health_data.get("t", 0))
       age = time.time() - health_timestamp
       
       if age > HEALTH_FRESH_SECS:
           return False, (
               f"WebSocket daemon health file is stale ({int(age)}s old).\n"
               "The daemon may have crashed or stopped responding.\n"
               "\n"
               "To restart the daemon:\n"
               "  Windows: .\\scripts\\force_restart.ps1\n"
               "  Linux/Mac: ./scripts/force_restart.sh"
           )
       
       # Health file is fresh - daemon is likely running
       return True, f"Daemon appears healthy (PID: {pid}, Sessions: {sessions})"
   ```

4. **Enhanced Connection Logic** (Lines 151-232)
   ```python
   async def _ensure_ws():
       # CRITICAL FIX: Check daemon health before attempting connection
       is_healthy, health_message = _check_daemon_health()
       if not is_healthy:
           logger.error(f"Daemon health check failed: {health_message}")
           raise RuntimeError(
               f"WebSocket daemon is not available.\n"
               f"\n"
               f"{health_message}\n"
               f"\n"
               f"Troubleshooting:\n"
               f"1. Check daemon status: python scripts/ws/ws_status.py\n"
               f"2. Check daemon logs: tail -f logs/ws_daemon.log\n"
               f"3. Verify port {EXAI_WS_PORT} is not in use\n"
               f"4. Check health file: cat logs/ws_daemon.health.json"
           )
       
       logger.info(f"Daemon health check passed: {health_message}")
       
       # ... connection attempts with better error messages ...
       
       # If connection fails after timeout
       raise RuntimeError(
           f"Failed to connect to WebSocket daemon at {uri} within {EXAI_WS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT}s.\n"
           f"\n"
           f"Last error: {last_err}\n"
           f"\n"
           f"The daemon appears to be running (health check passed), but connection failed.\n"
           f"This could indicate:\n"
           f"- Network connectivity issues\n"
           f"- Firewall blocking port {EXAI_WS_PORT}\n"
           f"- Daemon is overloaded or not responding\n"
           f"\n"
           f"Troubleshooting:\n"
           f"1. Restart daemon: .\\scripts\\force_restart.ps1\n"
           f"2. Check daemon logs: tail -f logs/ws_daemon.log\n"
           f"3. Verify port is listening: netstat -an | grep {EXAI_WS_PORT}"
       )
   ```

### Expected Impact
- ✅ Faster failure detection (10s instead of 30s)
- ✅ Clear recovery guidance in error messages
- ✅ Health check prevents unnecessary connection attempts
- ✅ Better ADHD-C user experience (fail fast with clear guidance)

---

## ✅ FIX 2: Progress Feedback Improvements (P1 - HIGH)

### Problem
- Tools taking 7+ seconds with no intermediate feedback
- ADHD-C users assume failure after 5s silence
- Progress messages not frequent enough

### Solution Implemented

**File:** `tools/workflow/expert_analysis.py`

**Changes:**

1. **Reduced Heartbeat Interval** (Lines 148-168)
   ```python
   def get_expert_heartbeat_interval_secs(self, request=None) -> float:
       """
       CRITICAL FIX: Reduced default from 10s to 2s for better UX.
       This provides more frequent progress updates for ADHD-C users.
       """
       try:
           return float(os.getenv("EXPERT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECS", "2"))  # Reduced from 10s
       except Exception:
           return 2.0  # Reduced from 10.0
   ```

2. **Removed Minimum Heartbeat Constraint** (Line 277)
   ```python
   # Before
   hb = max(5.0, self.get_expert_heartbeat_interval_secs(request))
   
   # After
   hb = self.get_expert_heartbeat_interval_secs(request)  # Allow 2s heartbeat
   ```

3. **Enhanced Progress Messages** (Lines 368-380)
   ```python
   # CRITICAL FIX: Enhanced progress message with elapsed time, ETA, and progress percentage
   elapsed = now - start
   remaining = max(0, deadline - now)
   progress_pct = min(100, int((elapsed / timeout_secs) * 100))
   try:
       send_progress(
           f"{self.get_name()}: Waiting on expert analysis (provider={provider.get_provider_type().value}) | "
           f"Progress: {progress_pct}% | Elapsed: {elapsed:.1f}s | ETA: {remaining:.1f}s"
       )
   except Exception:
       pass
   ```

4. **Enhanced Fallback Progress Messages** (Lines 336-348)
   ```python
   # CRITICAL FIX: Enhanced progress message for fallback provider
   elapsed_fb = now_fb - start
   remaining_fb = max(0, deadline - now_fb)
   progress_pct_fb = min(100, int((elapsed_fb / timeout_secs) * 100))
   try:
       send_progress(
           f"{self.get_name()}: Waiting on expert analysis (provider=kimi, fallback) | "
           f"Progress: {progress_pct_fb}% | Elapsed: {elapsed_fb:.1f}s | ETA: {remaining_fb:.1f}s"
       )
   except Exception:
       pass
   ```

### Expected Impact
- ✅ Progress updates every 2 seconds (instead of 5-10 seconds)
- ✅ Users see progress percentage, elapsed time, and ETA
- ✅ Reduces anxiety about operation status
- ✅ Better ADHD-C user experience (continuous feedback)

---

## ✅ FIX 3: Tool Discoverability (P1 - MEDIUM)

### Problem
- Tool names not self-explanatory
- Users must read documentation to understand functionality
- Increases cognitive load

### Solution Implemented

**File:** `tools/capabilities/listmodels.py`

**Changes:**

1. **Added Usage Hints to Output** (Lines 89-103)
   ```python
   output_lines = [
       "# Available AI Models\n",
       "💡 **TIP**: Use this tool to see which AI models you can call and their capabilities.\n",
       "**Quick Examples**:",
       "- Test a model: `chat_exai(prompt='test', model='kimi-latest')`",
       "- Check model health: `status_exai()`",
       "- List providers: See configured providers below\n",
   ]
   ```

### Expected Impact
- ✅ Users immediately understand what the tool does
- ✅ Quick examples show how to use related tools
- ✅ Reduces need to read documentation
- ✅ Better discoverability for new users

---

## ✅ FIX 4: JSON Parse Error Logging (P0 - CRITICAL)

### Problem
- Expert analysis returning non-JSON responses
- Warning message didn't provide enough diagnostic information
- Difficult to debug root cause

### Solution Implemented

**File:** `tools/workflow/expert_analysis.py`

**Changes:**

1. **Enhanced JSON Parse Error Logging** (Lines 370-397)
   ```python
   if model_response.content:
       try:
           # Log the raw response for debugging
           response_preview = model_response.content[:500]
           logger.debug(f"[EXPERT_ANALYSIS_DEBUG] Raw response preview: {response_preview}")
           
           analysis_result = json.loads(model_response.content.strip())
           logger.info(f"[EXPERT_ANALYSIS_DEBUG] Successfully parsed JSON response")
           return analysis_result
       except json.JSONDecodeError as json_err:
           # Enhanced logging for JSON parse errors
           logger.error(
               f"[EXPERT_ANALYSIS_DEBUG] JSON parse error: {json_err}\n"
               f"Response length: {len(model_response.content)} chars\n"
               f"Response preview (first 1000 chars): {model_response.content[:1000]}\n"
               f"Response preview (last 500 chars): {model_response.content[-500:]}"
           )
           return {
               "status": "analysis_complete",
               "raw_analysis": model_response.content,
               "parse_error": f"Response was not valid JSON: {str(json_err)}",
           }
   ```

### Expected Impact
- ✅ Full error details captured in logs
- ✅ Response length and preview logged
- ✅ Easier to identify pattern in non-JSON responses
- ✅ Better diagnostic capability for debugging
