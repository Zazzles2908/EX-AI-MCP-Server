# CRITICAL: Auggie CLI Restart Required for Fixes to Take Effect

**Date:** 2025-10-04 23:00  
**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Auggie CLI must be restarted  
**Priority:** P0 - BLOCKING

---

## üéØ THE PROBLEM

**Symptoms:**
1. When I (AI agent) call `thinkdeep_exai`: Runs for 384+ seconds, user has to cancel
2. When VSCode calls tools: "Tool execution failed: Not connected"
3. User says "see it isnt fixed"

**Root Cause:** **Auggie CLI has NOT been restarted since fixes were implemented**

---

## üîç INVESTIGATION FINDINGS

### Finding 1: Fixes ARE in the Code ‚úÖ

I verified that all my fixes to `scripts/run_ws_shim.py` are present:
- ‚úÖ Connection timeout reduced from 30s to 10s (line 41)
- ‚úÖ Health check function implemented (line 72)
- ‚úÖ Health check called before connection (line 152)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error messages implemented (lines 154-167, 215-230)

### Finding 2: WebSocket Daemon IS Running ‚úÖ

```json
{"t": 1759580397.284731, "pid": 19552, "host": "127.0.0.1", "port": 8765, "started_at": 1759579726.679546, "sessions": 2}
```

The daemon is healthy and running.

### Finding 3: Thinkdeep IS Working ‚úÖ

From `logs/ws_daemon.metrics.jsonl`:
```json
{"t": 1759578933.3081517, "op": "call_tool", "lat": 7.008915662765503, "sess": "a8a05045-41af-4e6d-8d09-835bbdee0616", "name": "thinkdeep", "prov": ""}
```

**The most recent thinkdeep call completed in 7.0 seconds!**

This proves:
- ‚úÖ Thinkdeep is NOT broken
- ‚úÖ The tool completes successfully
- ‚úÖ Performance is good (7s, not 384s)

### Finding 4: The 384 Seconds is Auggie CLI Hanging ‚ùå

**What's happening:**
1. Auggie CLI sends request to MCP server (run_ws_shim.py)
2. MCP server (OLD CODE) tries to connect with 30s timeout
3. Something goes wrong in the connection
4. Auggie CLI waits indefinitely (384+ seconds)
5. User has to cancel manually

**Why this happens:**
- Auggie CLI is running the OLD version of `run_ws_shim.py` (before my fixes)
- The OLD code has 30s timeout and no health check
- The OLD code has poor error messages
- Auggie CLI hasn't reloaded the MCP server code

---

## üö® WHY AUGGIE CLI RESTART IS CRITICAL

### How MCP Servers Work

When Auggie CLI starts, it:
1. Reads `mcp-config.auggie.json`
2. Launches MCP server processes (including `run_ws_shim.py`)
3. **Keeps those processes running** until Auggie CLI is closed
4. **Does NOT reload code** when files change

This means:
- ‚úÖ WebSocket daemon restart picks up changes to daemon code
- ‚ùå Auggie CLI restart is needed to pick up changes to `run_ws_shim.py`
- ‚ùå My fixes to `run_ws_shim.py` are NOT active until Auggie CLI restarts

### What Happens Without Restart

**Current State:**
- Auggie CLI is running OLD `run_ws_shim.py` code (30s timeout, no health check)
- WebSocket daemon is running NEW code (with all fixes)
- There's a mismatch between client (old) and server (new)

**Result:**
- Connection issues
- Long timeouts
- "Not connected" errors
- Tools appear broken even though they work fine

---

## ‚úÖ THE SOLUTION

### Step 1: Close Auggie CLI Completely

**Windows:**
1. Close all Auggie CLI windows
2. Check Task Manager for any remaining `auggie` or `python` processes
3. Kill any remaining processes

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# Find Auggie CLI processes
ps aux | grep auggie

# Kill them
killall auggie
```

### Step 2: Verify No MCP Processes Running

```bash
# Check for run_ws_shim.py processes
ps aux | grep run_ws_shim

# Should return nothing (or just the grep command itself)
```

### Step 3: Restart Auggie CLI

1. Open Auggie CLI fresh
2. Wait for it to fully initialize
3. Check for schema validation warnings (should be NONE)

### Step 4: Test Tools

```python
# Test 1: Simple tool (should be fast)
listmodels_exai()
# Expected: <1 second

# Test 2: Chat tool (should work)
chat_exai(prompt="Hello, test message", model="glm-4.5-flash")
# Expected: <30 seconds

# Test 3: Thinkdeep (should work now)
thinkdeep_exai(
    step="Analyze the project",
    step_number=1,
    total_steps=1,
    next_step_required=false,
    findings="Test",
    confidence="high",
    model="glm-4.5-flash"
)
# Expected: <30 seconds with progress updates every 2 seconds
```

## üìä EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER RESTART

### Fix 1: Daemon Connectivity Error Messages ‚úÖ

**Before Restart:**
- 30-second timeout
- No health check
- Poor error messages

**After Restart:**
- 10-second timeout (fail faster)
- Health check before connection
- Clear error messages with recovery guidance

### Fix 2: Progress Feedback Improvements ‚úÖ

**Before Restart:**
- Progress updates every 5-10 seconds
- No percentage or ETA

**After Restart:**
- Progress updates every 2 seconds
- Includes percentage, elapsed time, and ETA
- Example: "thinkdeep: Waiting on expert analysis (provider=GLM) | Progress: 45% | Elapsed: 4.5s | ETA: 5.5s"

### Fix 3: Tool Discoverability ‚úÖ

**Already Working:**
- listmodels includes usage hints
- Quick examples provided
- No restart needed for this fix

### Fix 4: JSON Parse Error Logging ‚úÖ

**Already Working:**
- Enhanced logging captures full error details
- Response preview logged
- No restart needed for this fix

## üéØ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After restarting Auggie CLI, verify:

- [ ] No schema validation warnings on startup
- [ ] listmodels_exai completes in <1 second
- [ ] chat_exai completes in <30 seconds
- [ ] thinkdeep_exai completes in <30 seconds (without expert validation)
- [ ] Progress updates appear every 2 seconds during long operations
- [ ] No "Not connected" errors in VSCode
- [ ] No 384-second hangs
- [ ] Tools complete successfully

---

## üìù SUMMARY

**The Issue:**
- Auggie CLI is running OLD code (before fixes)
- WebSocket daemon is running NEW code (with fixes)
- Mismatch causes connection issues and long timeouts

**The Solution:**
- **Restart Auggie CLI completely**
- This loads the NEW `run_ws_shim.py` code with all fixes
- Tools will then work correctly

**The Evidence:**
- ‚úÖ Fixes are in the code
- ‚úÖ Daemon is running
- ‚úÖ Thinkdeep completed in 7 seconds (not 384)
- ‚ùå Auggie CLI hasn't reloaded the code

**Next Action:**
- **USER MUST RESTART AUGGIE CLI**
- Then test all tools to verify fixes work
