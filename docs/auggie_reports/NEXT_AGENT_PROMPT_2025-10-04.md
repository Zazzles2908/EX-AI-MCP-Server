## üîß BUG FIXES TO TEST

### Bug #1: Web Search Integration ‚úÖ FIXED
**What was fixed:** Import path in `text_format_handler.py` line 108

**Test Command:**
```python
chat_exai(
    prompt="What are the latest Python async best practices in 2024?",
    use_websearch=true,
    model="glm-4.5-flash"
)
```

**Expected Result:**
- Web search executes successfully
- Returns results with sources
- No `<tool_call>web_search\nquery: ...` text

**Before Fix:**
- Returned tool_call as text instead of executing
- No search results in response

**If Test Fails:**
- Check server was restarted
- Verify `text_format_handler.py` has correct import
- Check logs for ImportError

---

### Bug #2: Expert Validation ‚úÖ FIXED
**What was fixed:** Added `DEFAULT_USE_ASSISTANT_MODEL` config, updated thinkdeep.py

**Test Command:**
```python
thinkdeep_exai(
    step="Analyze whether Python's asyncio or threading is better for I/O-bound tasks",
    step_number=1,
    total_steps=1,
    next_step_required=false,
    findings="Testing expert validation functionality",
    model="glm-4.5-flash",
    thinking_mode="low"
)
```

**Expected Result:**
- Returns `expert_analysis` with comprehensive insights
- NOT `expert_analysis: null`
- Expert analysis provides additional validation

**Before Fix:**
- Returned `expert_analysis: null`
- Only returned workflow scaffolding

**If Test Fails:**
- Check `config.py` has `DEFAULT_USE_ASSISTANT_MODEL = true`
- Verify `thinkdeep.py` updated with new priority order
- Check if tool-specific env override is set to false

---

### Bug #3: Model 'auto' Resolution ‚úÖ VERIFIED
**Status:** Already fixed in previous session, just verify it works

**Test Command:**
```python
chat_exai(
    prompt="Hello, test auto model resolution",
    model="auto"
)
```

**Expected Result:**
- Routes to appropriate model (likely glm-4.5-flash)
- No error: "Model 'auto' is not available"
- Response is generated successfully

---

- ‚úÖ Task 3.5: systemprompts/ audit (no changes needed - already well-organized)

**Total Progress:** 5/9 tasks (56%)  
**Lines Reduced:** 210 lines

## üéØ YOUR TASKS IN DETAIL

### Task 3.6: Handler Fragmentation Audit (2-3 hours)

**Goal:** Analyze 8 handler modules in `src/server/handlers/` for over-fragmentation or consolidation opportunities.

**Approach:**
1. Use `analyze_exai` or `refactor_exai` to review handler modules
2. Map handler flow with `tracer_exai` if needed
3. Identify fragmentation vs cohesion
4. Create consolidation plan if opportunities found

**Files to Review:**
- `src/server/handlers/request_handler.py`
- `src/server/handlers/request_handler_execution.py`
- `src/server/handlers/request_handler_model_resolution.py`
- `src/server/handlers/request_handler_context.py`
- `src/server/handlers/request_handler_post_processing.py`
- `src/server/handlers/mcp_handlers.py`
- Other handler files in the directory

**Questions to Answer:**
- Are handlers appropriately separated by concern?
- Is there duplication across handlers?
- Are any handlers too small/fragmented?
- Would consolidation improve maintainability?

---

### Task 3.7: tools/shared/ Systematic Review (2-3 hours)

**Goal:** Review all 6 core shared tool files for patterns and inconsistencies.

**Approach:**
1. Use `codereview_exai` to review each file
2. Identify patterns and anti-patterns
3. Create consolidation recommendations
4. Document findings

**Files to Review:**
- `tools/shared/base_tool.py`
- `tools/shared/base_tool_core.py`
- `tools/shared/base_tool_model_management.py`
- `tools/shared/base_models.py`
- `tools/shared/error_envelope.py`
- `tools/shared/schema_builder.py`

**Questions to Answer:**
- Are there consistent patterns across files?
- Is there code duplication?
- Are abstractions appropriate?
- Would refactoring improve clarity?

---

### Task 3.8: Provider Module Audit (3-4 hours)

**Goal:** Comprehensive audit of `src/providers/` ecosystem.

**Approach:**
1. Use `analyze_exai` to review provider ecosystem
2. Identify patterns and inconsistencies
3. Create consolidation plan
4. Document findings

**Areas to Review:**
- Provider implementations (glm_chat.py, kimi_chat.py, etc.)
- Provider registry and selection
- Provider capabilities
- Provider-specific utilities

**Questions to Answer:**
- Are providers consistently structured?
- Is there duplication across providers?
- Are capabilities properly abstracted?
- Would consolidation improve maintainability?

---

### Task 3.9: Legacy CLAUDE_* Variables Documentation (1 hour)

**Goal:** Document and create deprecation plan for legacy CLAUDE_* environment variables.

**Approach:**
1. Search codebase for all CLAUDE_* references
2. Document current usage
3. Create deprecation plan
4. Provide migration guide

**Files to Check:**
- `src/server/handlers/mcp_handlers.py` line 48
- Any other files with CLAUDE_* references

**Deliverables:**
- List of all CLAUDE_* variables
- Current usage documentation
- Deprecation timeline
- Migration guide for users

**Questions?** Review the reference documents or use `chat_exai` to brainstorm approaches.

**Stuck?** Document what you tried, what didn't work, and pass it to the next agent with clear context.

**Success?** Document everything clearly so the next agent can build on your work!
