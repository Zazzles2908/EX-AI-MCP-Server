# Documentation Maintenance Guide
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-04  
**Purpose:** Guidelines for maintaining clean, organized, and useful documentation

---

## üìã DOCUMENTATION PRINCIPLES

### 1. Single Source of Truth
- Each piece of information should exist in ONE authoritative location
- Use cross-references instead of duplicating content
- Update the authoritative source, not copies

### 2. Discoverability
- All documents must be indexed in `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Include metadata (date, status, purpose) at the top of each file

### 3. Freshness
- Mark documents with last updated date
- Archive superseded documents promptly
- Review and update quarterly

### 4. Clarity
- Write for the intended audience (users, developers, contributors)
- Use clear headings and structure
- Include examples where helpful

## üîÑ DOCUMENT LIFECYCLE

### 1. Creation
**When creating a new document:**
1. Choose appropriate directory based on purpose
2. Use descriptive filename (no generic names like README.md in subdirs)
3. Include metadata header:
   ```markdown
   # Document Title
   **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
   **Status:** Draft/Active/Archived
   **Purpose:** Brief description
   ```
4. Add entry to DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md
5. Link from related documents

### 2. Maintenance
**Regular maintenance tasks:**
- **Weekly:** Update CURRENT_STATUS.md
- **Monthly:** Review project-status/ for archival candidates
- **Quarterly:** Full documentation review
- **As needed:** Update when code/architecture changes

### 3. Archival
**When to archive:**
- Document is superseded by newer version
- Investigation/project is complete
- Content is historical but may be useful for reference
- File is older than 30 days and not actively referenced

**How to archive:**
1. Review for unique information
2. Extract and consolidate into current docs
3. Create archive directory with date: `archive/category-YYYY-MM-DD/`
4. Move file to archive
5. Update archive INDEX.md
6. Update cross-references in current docs
7. Remove from DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md or mark as archived

## üö® COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue: Too Many Files in project-status/
**Solution:** Archive files older than 30 days, consolidate similar files

### Issue: Duplicate Information
**Solution:** Identify authoritative source, update it, remove duplicates, add cross-references

### Issue: Broken Links
**Solution:** Use relative paths, update links when moving files, run link checker

### Issue: Outdated Information
**Solution:** Mark with "OUTDATED" banner, update or archive, set review schedule

### Issue: Can't Find Information
**Solution:** Improve DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md, add search tips, consolidate scattered info

## üéØ BEST PRACTICES

1. **Write for Your Audience:** Users need guides, developers need architecture docs
2. **Be Concise:** Shorter is better, link to details
3. **Use Examples:** Show, don't just tell
4. **Keep It Current:** Outdated docs are worse than no docs
5. **Link Generously:** Help readers find related information
6. **Archive Promptly:** Don't let old docs clutter active areas
7. **Index Everything:** If it's not in the index, it doesn't exist
8. **Version Control:** Use git for tracking changes
9. **Review Regularly:** Set calendar reminders
10. **Ask for Feedback:** Docs are for readers, not writers
