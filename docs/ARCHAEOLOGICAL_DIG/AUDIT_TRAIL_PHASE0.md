# ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIG - PHASE 0 AUDIT TRAIL
**Branch:** archaeological-dig/phase1-discovery-and-cleanup  
**Started:** 2025-10-10 12:55 PM AEDT  
**Status:** üîç IN PROGRESS

---

## PURPOSE

This document tracks EVERY action taken during Phase 0 of the archaeological dig. Phase 0 is the **architectural mapping phase** that comes BEFORE Phase 1.

**Why Phase 0 Exists:**
- User identified critical issue: fixing shared infrastructure without understanding architecture
- Need to understand src/ vs tools/ vs utils/ separation FIRST
- Need to map shared vs specific components FIRST
- Then make informed decisions in Phase 1

---

## PHASE 0 OVERVIEW

**Goal:** Map the entire architecture to understand what's SHARED vs SPECIFIC

**Approach:**
1. Complete system inventory (all folders/files)
2. Identify shared components (base classes, mixins, utilities)
3. Map dependencies (import graph)
4. Detect duplicates (same functionality in multiple places)
5. Recognize architecture pattern (intended design vs historical accident)
6. Create consolidation strategy

**Categories to Investigate:**
1. Layout Map (complete system inventory)
2. Shared Infrastructure (base classes, mixins, utilities)
3. Dependency Mapping (import graph)
4. Duplicate Detection (duplicates across src/, tools/, utils/)
5. Architecture Pattern (layered vs feature-based vs chaotic)
6. Consolidation Strategy (informed recommendations)

## INVESTIGATION LOG

### 2025-10-10 12:15 PM - Phase 1 Started (PAUSED)

**Action:** Started Phase 1 investigations
- Created Task 1.1: System Prompts Investigation
- Created Task 1.2: Timezone Utility Investigation
- Completed Task 1.1 ‚úÖ (systemprompts/ is ACTIVE)
- Started Task 1.2 (timezone investigation)

**Issue Discovered:**
- Found EXAI codereview tool error
- Attempted to fix bugs in expert_analysis.py and codereview.py
- User correctly identified this as problematic

---

### 2025-10-10 12:50 PM - Critical User Feedback

**User's Observation:**
> "src, tools and utils have a lot of overlap, which have additional sub folders"

**User's Concern:**
> "When I mention suggestions like this, then scripts start going in other places, which is difficult to track and not considered when other categories are tackled/assessed"

**User's Request:**
- Pause and reassess
- Revert code changes
- Create proper architectural assessment
- Understand what exists BEFORE making changes

**Action Taken:**
- ‚úÖ Reverted expert_analysis.py changes
- ‚úÖ Reverted codereview.py changes
- ‚úÖ Created SHARED_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERLAP_ANALYSIS.md
- ‚úÖ Identified need for Phase 0

---

### 2025-10-10 12:55 PM - Phase 0 Created

**Action:** Created Phase 0 - Architectural Mapping

**Documents Created:**
- MASTER_CHECKLIST_PHASE0.md - Complete task checklist
- AUDIT_TRAIL_PHASE0.md - This document
- shared_infrastructure/SHARED_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERLAP_ANALYSIS.md - Initial analysis

**Phase 0 Tasks:**
1. Task 0.1: Layout Map - Complete system inventory
2. Task 0.2: Shared Infrastructure Identification
3. Task 0.3: Dependency Mapping
4. Task 0.4: Duplicate Detection
5. Task 0.5: Architecture Pattern Recognition
6. Task 0.6: Consolidation Strategy

**Phase 1 Status:**
- Task 1.1: System Prompts ‚úÖ COMPLETE (no changes needed)
- Task 1.2: Timezone Utility ‚è∏Ô∏è PAUSED (resume after Phase 0)
- Tasks 1.3-1.7: NOT STARTED (will be informed by Phase 0)
- Task 1.8: Tools Structure ‚Üí MOVED TO PHASE 0 (Task 0.1, 0.2, 0.4)
- Task 1.9: Src Duplicates ‚Üí MOVED TO PHASE 0 (Task 0.1, 0.4)
- Task 1.10: Consolidation Strategy ‚Üí INFORMED BY PHASE 0 (Task 0.6)

## FINDINGS SUMMARY

### Critical Discovery: Three-Way Overlap

**src/ (11 subfolders):**
- bootstrap/, conf/, config/, conversation/, core/, daemon/, embeddings/, providers/, router/, server/, utils/
- **Duplicates:** conf/ vs config/, conversation/ (2 locations), providers/ (2 locations), utils/ (2 files only)

**tools/ (13 subfolders):**
- shared/, simple/, workflow/, workflows/, providers/, capabilities/, diagnostics/, audits/, cost/, reasoning/, streaming/
- **Confusion:** workflow/ vs workflows/, providers/ (duplicate with src/), streaming/ (duplicate with root)

**utils/ (30+ files, NO folders):**
- file_utils_*.py (7 files!), conversation_*.py (4 files), progress*.py (2 files), token_*.py (2 files)
- **Chaos:** No folder structure, many duplicates

### Critical Discovery: Shared Infrastructure Scattered

**Shared Components Found:**
- tools/workflow/expert_analysis.py (34KB!) - ExpertAnalysisMixin used by ALL workflow tools
- tools/shared/ - Base classes for all tools
- tools/simple/base.py - SimpleTool base class
- tools/workflow/base.py - WorkflowTool base class
- utils/ - 30+ utility files

**The Problem:**
- Shared infrastructure is scattered across src/, tools/, utils/
- Hard to know what's shared vs specific
- Changes to "shared" code have wide impact
- Difficult to track dependencies
