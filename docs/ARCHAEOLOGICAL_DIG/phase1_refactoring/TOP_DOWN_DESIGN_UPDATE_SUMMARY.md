# TOP-DOWN DESIGN UPDATE SUMMARY
**Date:** 2025-10-10 3:45 PM AEDT
**Purpose:** Summary of all documentation updates for Top-Down Design approach
**Status:** ✅ **APPROVED BY USER (2025-10-10 5:30 PM AEDT)**
**Next Step:** Complete Phase 1 Discovery (Tasks 1.3-1.10) before implementation

---

## USER FEEDBACK THAT TRIGGERED THIS UPDATE

### Feedback 1: Dependency Analysis Missing
> "How do you know what is existing to be put into what you are building? What about the complexity of what is in the script you are targeting, like how do you know what is targeted above that file and below that file?"

**Response:** Added complete dependency analysis BEFORE designing refactoring.

### Feedback 2: Building New Instead of Refactoring
> "It appeared you were building a template and filling it in afterwards... it looked like you were just building brand new."

**Response:** Pivot to Facade Pattern - preserve public interface, refactor internally.

### Feedback 3: Top-Down Design, Not Bottom-Up
> "Should be more like Top-Down Design (Stepwise Refinement or Decomposition) so it like splits into categories."

**Response:** Pivot from bottom-up "split code" to top-down "conceptual categories".

### Feedback 4: TRUE Top-Down Starts from Entry Points
> "I would consider the top being even to the point of the entrance point, which is the daemon and mcp server point right?"

**Response:** TRUE top-down starts from: User → IDE → MCP Server → Daemon → Tools

## WHAT CHANGED

### BEFORE (Bottom-Up Approach) ❌

**Organization:** By implementation details (what code does)

```
tools/simple/
├── prompt/
│   ├── builder.py          ← Code that builds prompts
│   └── file_handler.py     ← Code that handles files
├── request/
│   └── accessor.py         ← Code that accesses requests
├── validation/
│   ├── file_validator.py   ← Code that validates files
│   ├── size_validator.py   ← Code that validates sizes
│   └── temperature_validator.py  ← Code that validates temperature
├── response/
│   └── parser.py           ← Code that parses responses
├── schema/
│   └── generator.py        ← Code that generates schemas
└── execution/
    └── executor.py         ← Code that executes
```

**Total:** 9 files across 6 folders

**Problems:**
- ❌ Organized by what code does, not what it represents
- ❌ No clear conceptual boundaries
- ❌ Doesn't match domain language
- ❌ Hard to understand the flow

---

### AFTER (Top-Down Approach - Option C Hybrid) ✅

**Organization:** By conceptual responsibility (what concept it represents)

```
tools/simple/
├── base.py (SimpleTool - ORCHESTRATOR ~150-200 lines)
│
├── definition/         ← "What does this tool promise?"
│   └── schema.py      (Tool contract: input/output schema)
│
├── intake/             ← "What did the user ask for?" (Stage 1: Receive)
│   ├── accessor.py    (Extract request fields)
│   └── validator.py   (Validate request)
│
├── preparation/        ← "How do we ask the AI?" (Stage 2: Prepare)
│   ├── prompt.py      (Build prompts)
│   └── files.py       (Handle prompt files)
│
├── execution/          ← "How do we call the AI?" (Stage 3: Call)
│   └── caller.py      (Invoke AI model)
│
└── delivery/           ← "How do we deliver the result?" (Stage 4: Format)
    └── formatter.py   (Format and parse responses)
```

**Total:** 7 files across 5 folders (FEWER!)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Organized by conceptual responsibility
- ✅ Clear conceptual boundaries
- ✅ Matches domain language
- ✅ Easy to understand the flow
- ✅ Matches docstring: "1. Receive request, 2. Prepare prompt, 3. Call AI, 4. Format response"

## TRUE TOP-DOWN: STARTS FROM ENTRY POINTS

**Complete System Flow (Top-Down):**

```
1. USER
   ↓
2. Augment IDE (VSCode)
   ↓
3. MCP Protocol (stdio)
   ↓
4. MCP Server (mcp_server.py)
   ↓
5. WebSocket Daemon (ws_daemon.py)
   ↓
6. Tool Registry (SERVER_TOOLS)
   ↓
7. TOOL FRAMEWORKS
   ├── SimpleTool (4 tools)
   │   ├── definition/    ← Tool contract
   │   ├── intake/        ← Request processing
   │   ├── preparation/   ← Prompt building
   │   ├── execution/     ← Model calling
   │   └── delivery/      ← Response formatting
   │
   └── WorkflowTool (12 tools)
       ├── definition/
       ├── intake/
       ├── orchestration/
       └── delivery/
   ↓
8. BASE INFRASTRUCTURE
   ├── BaseTool
   ├── Mixins
   └── Utils
   ↓
9. EXTERNAL AI PROVIDERS
   ├── Kimi (Moonshot API)
   └── GLM (ZhipuAI)
```

**Key Insight:** Refactoring should follow this top-down flow, not bottom-up code splitting!
