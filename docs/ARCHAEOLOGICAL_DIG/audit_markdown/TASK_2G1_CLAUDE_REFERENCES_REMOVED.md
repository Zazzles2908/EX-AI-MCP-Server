# Task 2.G.1: Remove Claude References - COMPLETE

**Date:** 2025-10-11 (11th October 2025, Friday)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Duration:** ~1 hour  
**Agent:** Augment Agent (Claude Sonnet 4.5)

---

## üéØ OBJECTIVE

Remove all hardcoded "Claude" references from the codebase that incorrectly assume Claude is the only AI model, replacing them with model-agnostic terminology.

**Critical Issue:** User reported seeing:
```
CONVERSATION CONTINUATION: You can continue this discussion with Claude! (19 exchanges remaining)
```

This is incorrect because the system supports multiple AI models (GLM, Kimi) and multiple MCP clients (Claude Desktop, VS Code, Augment Code, etc.).

## üîç INVESTIGATION FINDINGS

### Files with Hardcoded "Claude" References

**User-Facing Code (CRITICAL):**
1. ‚úÖ `src/server/utils.py` - **FIXED**
   - Line 74: "You can continue this discussion with Claude!"
   - Line 79: "instruct Claude to use the continuation_id"
   - Line 90: "This ensures Claude knows both HOW to maintain..."
   - Line 93: "Claude can use in subsequent tool calls"
   - Line 97: "Claude to use the continuation_id"

**Documentation/Comments (MEDIUM):**
2. ‚úÖ `utils/conversation/history.py` - **FIXED**
   - Line 238: Example showing "Turn 1 (Claude)"
   
3. ‚úÖ `src/server/handlers/mcp_handlers.py` - **FIXED**
   - Line 93: "List all available prompts for Claude Code shortcuts"
   - Line 139: "Claude will then use to call the underlying tool"

4. ‚úÖ `utils/conversation/threads.py` - **FIXED**
   - Line 159: "role: 'user' (Claude) or 'assistant' (Gemini/O3/etc)"

5. ‚úÖ `src/server/context/thread_context.py` - **FIXED**
   - Line 90: "Claude: 'Continue analyzing...'"
   - Line 114: "Return error asking Claude to restart conversation"

6. ‚úÖ `tools/shared/base_tool_file_handling.py` - **FIXED**
   - Line 296: "by having Claude save large prompts to a file"

7. ‚úÖ `utils/conversation/models.py` - **FIXED**
   - Line 73: "role: 'user' (Claude) or 'assistant' (Gemini/O3/etc)"

**Legitimate References (KEPT):**
- `Daemon/mcp-config.claude.json` - Configuration for Claude Desktop client
- `run-server.ps1` - Claude Desktop client detection
- `utils/client_info.py` - CLIENT_NAME_MAPPINGS (maps "claude" ‚Üí "Claude")

## ‚úÖ CHANGES MADE

### 1. src/server/utils.py (PRIMARY FIX)

**Before:**
```python
return f"""
CONVERSATION CONTINUATION: You can continue this discussion with Claude! ({remaining_turns} exchanges remaining)

IMPORTANT: When you suggest follow-ups or ask questions, you MUST explicitly instruct Claude to use the continuation_id
to respond.

This ensures Claude knows both HOW to maintain the conversation thread...
"""
```

**After:**
```python
# Import dynamic client name
from utils.client_info import get_client_friendly_name

client_name = get_client_friendly_name()

return f"""
CONVERSATION CONTINUATION: You can continue this discussion! ({remaining_turns} exchanges remaining)

IMPORTANT: When you suggest follow-ups or ask questions, you MUST explicitly instruct the user to use the continuation_id
to respond.

This ensures the conversation thread is maintained properly...
"""
```

**Impact:** This is the PRIMARY fix for the user-reported issue. The system now:
- Removes hardcoded "Claude" from user-facing messages
- Uses generic "the user" instead of assuming a specific client
- Maintains the same functionality with model-agnostic language

**Note:** The `get_client_friendly_name()` function is imported but not currently used in the message text. This is intentional - we're using generic language ("the user") rather than dynamic client names to keep messages simple and consistent.

### 2. utils/conversation/history.py

**Before:**
```python
--- Turn 1 (Claude) ---
--- Turn 2 (Gemini using analyze via google/gemini-2.5-flash) ---
```

**After:**
```python
--- Turn 1 (User) ---
--- Turn 2 (Assistant using analyze via glm-4.6) ---
```

**Impact:** Documentation example now uses model-agnostic terminology and reflects the actual models in this system (GLM, Kimi).

### 3. src/server/handlers/mcp_handlers.py

**Before:**
```python
"""
List all available prompts for Claude Code shortcuts.
It generates the appropriate text that Claude will then use to call the underlying tool.
"""
```

**After:**
```python
"""
List all available prompts for MCP client shortcuts.
It generates the appropriate text that the MCP client will then use to call the underlying tool.
"""
```

**Impact:** Comments now correctly describe the MCP protocol, not a specific client.

### 4. utils/conversation/threads.py

**Before:**
```python
role: "user" (Claude) or "assistant" (Gemini/O3/etc)
model_provider: Provider used (e.g., "google", "openai")
model_name: Specific model used (e.g., "gemini-2.5-flash", "o3-mini")
```

**After:**
```python
role: "user" (from MCP client) or "assistant" (from AI model)
model_provider: Provider used (e.g., "glm", "kimi")
model_name: Specific model used (e.g., "glm-4.6", "kimi-k2-0905-preview")
```

**Impact:** Documentation reflects the actual providers and models in this system.

### 5. src/server/context/thread_context.py

**Before:**
```python
Example Usage Flow:
    1. Claude: "Continue analyzing the security issues" + continuation_id
    
# Return error asking Claude to restart conversation with full context
```

**After:**
```python
Example Usage Flow:
    1. User: "Continue analyzing the security issues" + continuation_id
    
# Return error asking user to restart conversation with full context
```

**Impact:** Examples and error messages use generic "user" terminology.

### 6. tools/shared/base_tool_file_handling.py

**Before:**
```python
This mechanism allows us to work around MCP's ~25K token limit by having
Claude save large prompts to a file
```

**After:**
```python
This mechanism allows us to work around MCP's ~25K token limit by having
the MCP client save large prompts to a file
```

**Impact:** Comment correctly describes the MCP protocol mechanism.

### 7. utils/conversation/models.py

**Before:**
```python
role: "user" (Claude) or "assistant" (Gemini/O3/etc)
model_provider: Provider used (e.g., "google", "openai")
model_name: Specific model used (e.g., "gemini-2.5-flash", "o3-mini")
```

**After:**
```python
role: "user" (from MCP client) or "assistant" (from AI model)
model_provider: Provider used (e.g., "glm", "kimi")
model_name: Specific model used (e.g., "glm-4.6", "kimi-k2-0905-preview")
```

**Impact:** Documentation reflects the actual system architecture.

## üß™ TESTING REQUIRED

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test conversation continuation with GLM model
- [ ] Test conversation continuation with Kimi model
- [ ] Verify continuation message no longer mentions "Claude"
- [ ] Test with Augment Code client
- [ ] Test with VS Code client
- [ ] Test with Claude Desktop client (should still work)
- [ ] Verify error messages are model-agnostic
- [ ] Check logs for any remaining "Claude" references in output

### Expected Behavior

**Before Fix:**

CONVERSATION CONTINUATION: You can continue this discussion with Claude! (19 exchanges remaining)
```

**After Fix:**
```
CONVERSATION CONTINUATION: You can continue this discussion! (19 exchanges remaining)
```

## üìä IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### User-Facing Impact
- **HIGH**: Primary user-reported issue is fixed
- Users will no longer see confusing "Claude" references when using other clients
- Messages are now consistent with the multi-provider architecture

### Code Quality Impact
- **MEDIUM**: Improved code documentation accuracy
- Comments now reflect actual system architecture (GLM/Kimi, not Gemini/O3)
- Examples use realistic model names from this system

### Breaking Changes
- **NONE**: All changes are backward compatible
- Functionality remains identical
- Only text/comments changed, no logic modified

---

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [x] All hardcoded "Claude" references in user-facing code removed
- [x] All documentation examples updated to use model-agnostic terminology
- [x] All comments updated to reflect actual system architecture
- [x] No breaking changes introduced
- [ ] Manual testing confirms fix works (pending)
- [ ] Server restart confirms changes are active (pending)

## üìù NEXT STEPS

1. **Restart Server** - Changes require server restart to take effect
2. **Manual Testing** - Test conversation continuation with multiple models
3. **Verify Fix** - Confirm user no longer sees "Claude" in continuation messages
4. **Document** - Update Phase 2 Cleanup status to mark Task 2.G.1 complete
