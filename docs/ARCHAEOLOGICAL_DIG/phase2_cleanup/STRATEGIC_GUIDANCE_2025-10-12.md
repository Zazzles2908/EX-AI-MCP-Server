## üö® CRITICAL BLOCKERS

### Blocker #1: Daemon Stability (P0 - PRODUCTION CRITICAL)
**Impact:** Blocks all testing tasks (2.I, 2.G, 2.N)  
**Evidence:**
- Server crashed during initial testing attempt
- WebSocket connection fails with "Not connected" errors
- Test environment cannot initialize providers
- 3 WorkflowTools crash daemon during testing (historical evidence)

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
- File inclusion bloat (1,742 files) overwhelming daemon
- Memory/resource exhaustion
- WebSocket connection management issues
- Provider initialization timing problems

**Priority:** MUST FIX FIRST - Nothing else can proceed reliably

---

### Blocker #2: Test Environment Initialization (P1)
**Impact:** Automated testing not possible  
**Evidence:**
- Test script fails: "Model 'glm-4.5-flash' is not available. Available models: {}"
- Providers not initialized outside MCP context
- Direct EXAI tool calls fail

**Workaround:** Manual testing via Augment Code (when daemon is stable)

---

### Blocker #3: WebSocket Connection Timing (P2)
**Impact:** Cannot use EXAI tools directly after restart  
**Evidence:** Multiple "Not connected" errors  
**Workaround:** Wait longer after restart OR use direct provider calls

---

## üìã RECOMMENDED TASK SEQUENCE

### PHASE 1: UNBLOCK TESTING (CRITICAL PATH)

#### Step 1: Daemon Stability Investigation (Task 2.J) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
**Why First:** Blocks all other testing tasks  
**Approach:**
1. Analyze daemon crash logs (`logs/ws_daemon.log`)
2. Check memory usage during crashes
3. Review file inclusion behavior in logs
4. Identify resource exhaustion patterns
5. Test daemon with minimal load
6. Implement fixes (likely file filtering)
7. Validate stability with stress testing

**Success Criteria:**
- Daemon runs for 30+ minutes without crashes
- Can handle multiple tool calls consecutively
- Memory usage remains stable
- WebSocket connections remain active

**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours  
**Risk:** HIGH - May uncover deeper architectural issues

---

#### Step 2: Complete Task 2.I (File Inclusion Bug Validation)
**Why Second:** Bug fix already applied, just needs validation  
**Approach:**
1. Wait for daemon stability (Step 1)
2. Manual testing via Augment Code:
   - Call analyze_EXAI-WS with simple test
   - Call codereview_EXAI-WS with relevant_files
   - Call refactor_EXAI-WS with simple test
   - Call secaudit_EXAI-WS with simple test
3. Monitor logs for file inclusion behavior
4. Verify no file bloat occurs
5. Confirm daemon remains stable
6. Document results

**Success Criteria:**
- All 4 tools execute without crashes
- No files included in expert analysis (EXPERT_ANALYSIS_INCLUDE_FILES=false respected)
- Daemon remains stable throughout testing
- Logs show correct behavior

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours (after Step 1 complete)  
**Risk:** LOW - Bug fix already verified in code

---

### PHASE 2: DOCUMENTATION & DECISIONS (PARALLEL WORK)

#### Step 3: SimpleTool Refactoring Decision (Task 2.M)
**Why Third:** Can be done while daemon stability is being fixed  
**Approach:**
1. Review current SimpleTool state (conservative partial extraction)
2. Evaluate original goal (Facade Pattern, 150-200 lines)
3. Assess risks vs benefits of full refactoring
4. Consider Phase 3 refactoring plans
5. Make decision: Continue partial OR commit to full refactoring
6. Document decision with rationale
7. Get user approval

**Options:**
- **Option A:** Keep conservative approach (lower risk, technical debt remains)
- **Option B:** Complete Facade Pattern (higher risk, cleaner architecture)
- **Option C:** Defer to Phase 3 (systematic refactoring with other tools)

**Recommendation:** Option C - Defer to Phase 3 for systematic refactoring

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour  
**Risk:** LOW - Decision-making, not implementation

---

#### Step 4: Performance Benchmarking (Task 2.L)
**Why Fourth:** Validates optimization claims, independent of daemon stability  
**Approach:**
1. Define baseline metrics (response time, memory usage, throughput)
2. Create benchmark test suite
3. Run benchmarks for key operations:
   - File upload (Kimi semantic caching)
   - Parallel uploads
   - Model routing
   - Tool execution
4. Compare against pre-optimization baselines (if available)
5. Document results
6. Identify any performance regressions

**Success Criteria:**
- Baseline metrics established
- Optimization claims validated or corrected
- Performance regressions identified
- Results documented

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Risk:** MEDIUM - May reveal performance issues

---

### PHASE 3: COMPREHENSIVE TESTING (AFTER UNBLOCKING)

#### Step 5: Integration Testing Suite (Task 2.N)
**Why Fifth:** Requires stable daemon  
**Approach:**
1. Design comprehensive test scenarios
2. Create test suite covering:
   - All 29 tools
   - Common workflows
   - Edge cases
   - Error handling
3. Implement automated tests
4. Run full test suite
5. Document results
6. Fix any issues discovered

**Success Criteria:**
- All tools tested in realistic scenarios
- Test suite automated and repeatable
- All tests pass OR issues documented
- Coverage report generated

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours  
**Risk:** HIGH - May uncover many issues

---

#### Step 6: Comprehensive System Testing (Task 2.G)
**Why Sixth:** Requires stable daemon + integration tests  
**Approach:**
1. Execute full system test plan
2. Test all critical paths
3. Validate all bug fixes
4. Stress test daemon
5. Document all results
6. Create issue list for any failures

**Success Criteria:**
- All critical paths tested
- All bug fixes validated
- Daemon stability confirmed
- Results documented

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours  
**Risk:** MEDIUM - Comprehensive validation

---

#### Step 7: Expert Validation & Summary (Task 2.H)
**Why Last:** Requires all other tasks complete  
**Approach:**
1. Compile all Phase 2 work
2. Request expert review (via EXAI or user)
3. Address feedback
4. Create comprehensive summary
5. Update all documentation
6. Mark Phase 2 complete

**Success Criteria:**
- Expert review completed
- Feedback addressed
- Phase 2 summary created
- All documentation updated

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Risk:** LOW - Summary and validation

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk #1: Daemon Stability Unfixable
**Probability:** LOW  
**Impact:** CRITICAL  
**Mitigation:**
- Investigate thoroughly before declaring unfixable
- Consider architectural changes if needed
- Escalate to user if fundamental redesign required
- Document all attempts and findings

### Risk #2: Testing Reveals Major Issues
**Probability:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** HIGH  
**Mitigation:**
- Expect issues - this is why we test
- Document all issues systematically
- Prioritize fixes by severity
- Don't try to fix everything at once

### Risk #3: Phase 2 Extends Beyond Timeline
**Probability:** HIGH  
**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Mitigation:**
- User has no timeline constraints (confirmed in memories)
- Focus on quality over speed
- Systematic approach prevents wasted effort
- Regular progress updates

---

## üéì KEY INSIGHTS

1. **Daemon stability is the critical path** - Everything else depends on it
2. **Manual testing is viable** - Don't let automated testing blockers stop progress
3. **Documentation tasks can proceed in parallel** - Use time wisely
4. **Systematic approach is working** - Continue following it
5. **Realistic expectations** - Some tasks will take longer than expected
