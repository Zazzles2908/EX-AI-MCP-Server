**Branch:** archaeological-dig/phase1-discovery-and-cleanup  
**Started:** 2025-10-10 12:15 PM AEDT  
**Status:** üîç IN PROGRESS

---

## PURPOSE

This document tracks EVERY action taken during Phase 1 of the archaeological dig. It serves as:
- Complete audit trail of all investigations
- Timeline of discoveries
- Evidence for all classifications
- Justification for all recommendations

---

## PHASE 1 OVERVIEW

**Goal:** Systematically investigate entire codebase to determine what's ACTIVE, ORPHANED, or DUPLICATE

**Approach:**
1. Search for imports (grep)
2. Check .env configuration
3. Read implementation files
4. Classify components
5. Document findings
6. Create consolidation strategy

**Categories to Investigate:**
1. System Prompts (systemprompts/)
2. Timezone Utility (src/utils/timezone.py)
3. Model Routing (src/providers/registry*.py)
4. Utils Folder (utils/ - 30+ files)
5. Monitoring (monitoring/ - 9 files)
6. Security/RBAC (security/ - 2 files)
7. Streaming (streaming/ + tools/streaming/)
8. Tools Structure (tools/ - 40+ files)
9. Src Duplicates (src/ - multiple duplicates)
10. Consolidation Strategy
