## WHAT EXISTS

### Tools Folder Structure (High-Level)
```
tools/
├── __init__.py                  # Package initialization
├── registry.py                  # Tool registry
├── models.py                    # Tool models/schemas

└── workflows/                   # Workflow implementations
```

**Total:** 40+ files across 13 subfolders

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY: DUPLICATE FOLDER NAMES

### 🚨 MAJOR ISSUE: workflow/ vs workflows/

**Two separate folders:**
1. `tools/workflow/` - Base classes for workflows
2. `tools/workflows/` - Workflow implementations

**This is confusing!**
- Similar names
- Related functionality
- Unclear separation

**Questions:**
- Why two folders?
- What's the intended separation?
- Should they be consolidated?

## ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Three-Layer Tool Architecture

**Layer 1: Base Classes (tools/shared/)**
- Core functionality
- Shared utilities
- Error handling
- Schema building

**Layer 2: Tool Type Base (tools/simple/ or tools/workflow/)**
- Simple tools: Extend shared base
- Workflow tools: Extend shared base + workflow features

**Layer 3: Tool Implementations (tools/workflows/ or root)**
- Actual tool implementations
- Extend appropriate base class
- Implement specific functionality

### Pattern 2: Workflow Tool Pattern

**Each workflow tool has 3 files:**
1. `{tool}.py` - Main implementation
2. `{tool}_config.py` - Configuration
3. `{tool}_models.py` - Data models

**Example:**
- `analyze.py` - Main analyze tool
- `analyze_config.py` - Analyze configuration
- `analyze_models.py` - Analyze data models

**This is excellent design!**
- Separation of concerns
- Easy to maintain
- Clear structure

## PRELIMINARY FINDINGS

### Finding 1: Well-Organized Tool Architecture
- ✅ Clear three-layer architecture
- ✅ Modular base classes
- ✅ Consistent workflow pattern
- ✅ Good separation of concerns

### Finding 2: Confusing Folder Names
- 🚨 workflow/ vs workflows/ (similar names)
- 🚨 streaming/ vs tools/streaming/ (duplicate?)
- 🚨 providers/ vs tools/providers/ (duplicate?)

### Finding 3: Excellent Workflow Pattern
**Each workflow has:**
- Main implementation
- Configuration file
- Data models file

**This is professional design!**
- Easy to maintain
- Clear structure
- Separation of concerns

### Finding 4: Many Subfolders
**13 subfolders in tools/:**
- Some are well-organized (workflows/)
- Some are unclear (audits/, cost/, reasoning/)
- Some may be duplicates (streaming/, providers/)

---

## CRITICAL QUESTIONS

### 1. workflow/ vs workflows/
**Question:** Why two folders with similar names?

**Hypothesis:**
- workflow/ = Base classes
- workflows/ = Implementations

**Need to verify:**
- Read code to confirm
- Check if this is intentional
- Consider renaming for clarity

**Suggestion:**
- Rename workflow/ to workflow_base/?
- Or move workflow/ into shared/?

### 2. tools/streaming/ vs streaming/
**Question:** Are these related or duplicate?

**Need to investigate:**
- What's in tools/streaming/?
- How does it relate to streaming/?
- Should they be consolidated?

### 3. tools/providers/ vs src/providers/
**Question:** Why provider code in two places?

**Need to understand:**
- What's in tools/providers/?
- How does it relate to src/providers/?
- Is this intentional separation?

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS (PRELIMINARY)

### Phase 1: Investigate Relationships (Immediate)

**Action:** Understand folder relationships

**Investigate:**
1. workflow/ vs workflows/
2. tools/streaming/ vs streaming/
3. tools/providers/ vs src/providers/

### Phase 2: Consider Renaming

**Action:** Rename confusing folders

**Suggestions:**
- `workflow/` → `workflow_base/` (clearer)
- Or move `workflow/` into `shared/workflow/`

### Phase 3: Check for Duplicates

**Action:** Identify duplicate functionality

**Check:**
- Is streaming/ duplicated in tools/streaming/?
- Is providers/ duplicated in tools/providers/?
- Should they be consolidated?

### Phase 4: Document Architecture

**Action:** Create architecture diagram

**Show:**
- Three-layer tool architecture
- Folder relationships
- Dependency graph
- Design patterns

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate:** Investigate workflow/ vs workflows/
2. **Then:** Investigate tools/streaming/ contents
3. **Then:** Investigate tools/providers/ contents
4. **Then:** Read tools/registry.py
5. **Finally:** Create architecture diagram

**STATUS: AWAITING DETAILED INVESTIGATION**

Next: Read workflow/base.py and workflows/analyze.py to understand relationship.
