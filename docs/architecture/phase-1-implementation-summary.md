## Part 2: Dynamic Step Management ✅ DESIGN + IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

### Design Documents Created

1. **step-management-current-architecture.md** (300 lines)
   - Documented current manual step management
   - Identified that consensus and docgen already use dynamic steps
   - Found opportunities for enhancement

2. **ai-manager-dynamic-step-design.md** (300 lines)
   - Designed GLM-4.5-flash based AI manager
   - Created complexity assessment matrix
   - Defined 3-phase implementation roadmap

3. **agentic-enhancement-system-design.md** (300 lines)
   - Designed self-assessment capabilities
   - Designed dynamic step adjustment
   - Designed early termination logic

### Implementation Completed

#### A. Agentic Enhancement Methods (tools/workflow/base.py)

**Added 3 new methods to WorkflowTool base class:**

1. **`get_minimum_steps_for_tool()`**
   - Returns minimum steps required before early termination
   - Default: 2 steps
   - Override in subclasses for tool-specific minimums

2. **`assess_information_sufficiency(request)`**
   - Self-assessment of investigation progress
   - Returns: sufficient (bool), confidence (str), missing_information (list), rationale (str)
   - Enables autonomous decision-making

3. **`should_terminate_early(request)`**
   - Determines if workflow can complete early
   - Criteria: confidence == "certain" AND sufficient info AND min steps met
   - Returns: (should_terminate, rationale)

4. **`request_additional_steps(request, reason, additional_steps)`**
   - Allows mid-workflow step increase
   - Logs rationale for transparency
   - Tracks adjustment history

**Code Changes:**
- Added ~150 lines of agentic enhancement logic
- Fully backward compatible (existing workflows unaffected)
- Well-documented with comprehensive docstrings

#### B. Workflow Orchestration Enhancement (tools/workflow/orchestration.py)

**Modified `execute_workflow()` method:**

```python
# AGENTIC ENHANCEMENT: Check for early termination
if request.next_step_required:
    should_terminate, termination_reason = self.should_terminate_early(request)
    if should_terminate:
        logger.info(f"{self.get_name()}: Early termination triggered - {termination_reason}")
        request.next_step_required = False
        self.early_termination_reason = termination_reason
```

**Modified `build_base_response()` method:**

```python
# AGENTIC ENHANCEMENT: Add early termination reason if applicable
if hasattr(self, 'early_termination_reason') and self.early_termination_reason:
    response_data["early_termination"] = True
    response_data["early_termination_reason"] = self.early_termination_reason
```

**Code Changes:**
- Added ~15 lines for early termination integration
- Transparent logging of all decisions
- Response includes termination reason when applicable

#### C. System Prompt Enhancement (systemprompts/analyze_prompt.py)

**Added Agentic Workflow Behavior section:**

```markdown
AGENTIC WORKFLOW BEHAVIOR
You are an autonomous agent capable of self-assessment and adaptive investigation. At each step:

1. SELF-ASSESS PROGRESS: Have you gathered sufficient information?
2. MAKE AUTONOMOUS DECISIONS: Complete early, adjust steps, or continue
3. EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING: Clear rationale in findings

CONFIDENCE LEVELS: exploring → low → medium → high → very_high → almost_certain → certain

EARLY TERMINATION: May complete early if confidence="certain" AND sufficient info AND min 3 steps
```

**Code Changes:**
- Added ~30 lines of agentic guidance
- Template for other workflow tools
- Clear, actionable instructions for AI agents
