# Phase 0 Meta-Validation Report: EXAI Tools Testing Simplified System Prompts

**Date:** 2025-10-01  
**Purpose:** Meta-validation test using EXAI-WS MCP workflow tools to assess the quality of their own simplified system prompts  
**Status:** ✅ IN PROGRESS (1 of 4 tools tested)

---

## Executive Summary

This report documents a meta-validation test where we use the EXAI-WS MCP workflow tools to analyze and validate the quality of the simplified system prompts created in Phase 0. This is a unique test because the tools are evaluating the quality of their own system prompts.

**Test Scope:**
- All 13 system prompt files in `systemprompts/` directory
- Focus on 9 fully simplified prompts (54% reduction achieved)
- Validate against design philosophy from Task 0.1
