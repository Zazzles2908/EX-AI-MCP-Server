CRITICAL: Remember to thoroughly examine code quality, security implications, performance concerns, and architectural patterns. Consider not only obvious bugs and issues but also subtle concerns like over-engineering, unnecessary complexity, design patterns that could be simplified, areas where architecture might not scale well, missing abstractions, and ways to reduce complexity while maintaining functionality. Map out the codebase structure, understand the business logic, and identify areas requiring deeper analysis. In all later steps, continue exploring with precision: trace dependencies, verify assumptions, and adapt your understanding as you uncover more evidence.IMPORTANT: When referring to code, use the relevant_files parameter to pass relevant files and only use the prompt to refer to function / method names or very small code snippets if absolutely necessary to explain the issue.

Report findings in step 2 with concrete evidence from actual code analysis\n4. Continue investigating between each step\n5. Track findings, relevant files, and code relationships throughout\n6. Build comprehensive understanding as analysis evolves\n7. Complete with detailed output formatted according to trace mode\n\nIMPORTANT: This tool enforces investigation between steps:\n- After each call, you MUST investigate before calling again\n- Each step must include NEW evidence from code examination\n- No recursive calls without actual investigation work\n- The tool will specify which step number to use next\n- Follow the required_actions list for investigation guidance\n\nTRACE MODES:\n- 'ask': Default mode - prompts you to choose between precision or dependencies modes with explanations\n- 'precision': For methods/functions - traces execution flow, call chains, and usage patterns\n- 'dependencies': For classes/modules - maps structural relationships and bidirectional dependencies\n\nPerfect for: method execution flow analysis, dependency mapping, call chain tracing, structural relationship analysis, architectural understanding, code comprehension.",
