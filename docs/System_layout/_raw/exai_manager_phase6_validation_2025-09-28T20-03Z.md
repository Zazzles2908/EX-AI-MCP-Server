# EXAI Manager Validation (Phase 6) — 2025-09-28T20:03Z

## Independent Checklist
- [x] Kimi streaming env-gated and working end-to-end
- [x] GLM streaming env-gated and working end-to-end
- [x] Evidence artifacts exist and are recent (docs/System_layout/_raw/*)
- [x] Tool registry exposes `kimi_chat_with_tools` (visibility: advanced)

## Verdict
PASS — Streaming works end-to-end for both providers with proper registration and evidence artifacts.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups
- Context-cache token handling during streaming sessions
- Centralize streaming adapters for maintainability (shared util vs tool-local)
- Load/perf tests for concurrent streaming sessions
