# EX-AI-MCP-Server Phase Implementation Plan

## Phase Objectives & Dependencies

### Phase 0: Foundation & Setup
- **Objectives**: Initialize project structure, establish development environment, configure core dependencies
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - Project structure established with proper directories
  - Core dependencies (MCP server, GLM, Kimi, Zhipu) installed and configured
  - Basic development workflow operational

### Phase 1: Core Architecture
- **Objectives**: Implement manager-first architecture foundation, establish routing framework
- **Dependencies**: Phase 0
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Manager service core implemented
  - Basic routing infrastructure in place
  - Service communication patterns established

### Phase 2: Basic MCP Integration
- **Objectives**: Implement MCP WebSocket daemon integration, establish basic protocol handlers
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - MCP WS daemon operational
  - Basic message handling implemented
  - Protocol compliance verified

### Phase 3: GLM-4.5-flash Routing (Priority)
- **Objectives**: Implement GLM-4.5-flash integration, establish intelligent routing logic
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1, 2
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - GLM-4.5-flash API integration complete
  - Manager-first routing logic functional
  - Request/response handling optimized

### Phase 4: Zhipu Web Search Integration (Priority)
- **Objectives**: Implement native Zhipu web search capabilities, integrate with routing system
- **Dependencies**: Phase 3
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Zhipu search API integration complete
  - Search results properly formatted and routed
  - Search functionality accessible through MCP interface

### Phase 5: Context Caching Foundation
- **Objectives**: Implement context caching system, establish cache management policies
- **Dependencies**: Phase 3
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Context caching infrastructure in place
  - Cache eviction and update policies implemented
  - Performance benchmarks established

### Phase 6: Kimi File Processing & Streaming (Priority)
- **Objectives**: Implement Kimi file processing capabilities, establish streaming functionality
- **Dependencies**: Phase 2, 5
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Kimi file upload and processing operational
  - Streaming functionality implemented
  - Large file handling optimized

### Phase 7: Advanced Features & Optimization
- **Objectives**: Implement advanced routing optimizations, enhance error handling, add monitoring
- **Dependencies**: Phase 3, 4, 5, 6
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Performance optimizations complete
  - Comprehensive error handling implemented
  - Monitoring and logging operational

### Phase 8: Testing & Deployment
- **Objectives**: Comprehensive testing, documentation, production deployment preparation
- **Dependencies**: All previous phases
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Full test suite passing
  - Documentation complete
  - Deployment pipeline operational

## Key Dependencies Summary
- **Phase 3 (GLM Routing)** depends on core architecture (Phase 1) and MCP integration (Phase 2)
- **Phase 4 (Zhipu Search)** depends on GLM routing (Phase 3) for proper integration
- **Phase 6 (Kimi Processing)** depends on MCP integration (Phase 2) and context caching (Phase 5)
- **Phase 7 (Optimization)** depends on all priority phases being complete
- **Phase 8 (Deployment)** is the final phase requiring all previous work

This plan maintains the current MCP WS daemon structure while incrementally adding the new capabilities, with clear prioritization on phases 3-4 and 6 as requested.
