# System State Investigation & Root Cause Analysis
**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Investigator:** Claude (Augment Agent)  
**Method:** Timeline analysis + EXAI consultation  
**Status:** üîç ACTIVE INVESTIGATION

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING:** The project documentation (roadmaps, fix plans) is significantly out of sync with the actual codebase state. Many "critical bugs" listed in roadmaps have already been fixed, while actual current issues remain undocumented.

**Root Cause:** Documentation drift - fixes were implemented but roadmaps weren't updated, leading to wasted effort on already-solved problems.

**Recommendation:** Shift from roadmap-driven development to **observation-driven development** - run the system, observe actual failures, fix real issues.

## Timeline Analysis (Reverse Chronological)

### **2025-10-21 (Today) - Session Activity**

**What We Did:**
1. ‚úÖ Documentation consolidation: 665+ files ‚Üí 83 files (87.5% reduction)
2. ‚úÖ Fixed codereview empty response bug (glm-4.6 ‚Üí glm-4.5-flash, high ‚Üí medium thinking)
3. ‚úÖ Discovered documentation drift issue

**Git Commits:**
- `ebe91fe` - fix: Resolve codereview empty response bug (Bug #11)
- `9faf27f` - docs: MAJOR consolidation - 665+ files to 83 files
- `ed6a7f6` - chore: Pre-consolidation checkpoint

**EXAI Consultation Results:**
- Confirmed documentation consolidation was "overwhelmingly positive"
- Identified that we were treating symptoms (timeouts) instead of root causes
- Recommended investigating semaphore leaks, expert analysis performance, infinite loops
- **CRITICAL:** Discovered semaphore leak was already fixed!

## Current System State Assessment

### ‚úÖ **FIXED Issues (Verified in Code)**

1. **Semaphore Leak (Week 1 #1)** - FIXED
   - File: `src/daemon/ws/request_router.py` lines 302-360
   - Proper try/finally blocks in place
   - Semaphores released even on timeout/exception
   - Commit: `72f0053`

2. **Codereview Empty Response (Bug #11)** - FIXED
   - Changed model: glm-4.6 ‚Üí glm-4.5-flash
   - Reduced thinking mode: high ‚Üí medium
   - Prevents Augment Code timeout
   - Commit: `ebe91fe`

3. **Documentation Chaos** - FIXED
   - Consolidated 665+ files ‚Üí 83 files
   - Clear navigation with 00_START_HERE.md
   - Commit: `9faf27f`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **UNKNOWN Status (Need Verification)**

1. **_inflight_reqs Memory Leak (Week 1 #2)**
   - Roadmap claims it's never cleaned up
   - Need to verify if cleanup was added

2. **Workflow Tools Infinite Loop (Bug #9/#10)**
   - Circuit breaker exists and works (tested with debug tool)
   - But roadmap claims it only logs warnings
   - Need to verify current behavior

3. **Expert Analysis Performance (30-60s)**
   - We "fixed" it by using faster model
   - But didn't investigate WHY it's slow
   - Need to profile actual bottleneck

### üîç **NEED INVESTIGATION**

1. **Actual Current Errors**
   - Check recent error logs
   - Identify real failures happening NOW
   - Not theoretical issues from roadmaps

2. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - Profile expert analysis execution
   - Measure actual latency sources
   - Identify blocking operations

3. **Resource Usage**
   - Monitor semaphore health in production
   - Check for memory leaks in running system
   - Verify cleanup mechanisms work

## EXAI Recommendations (To Implement)

### **Phase 1: Diagnostic Infrastructure (PRIORITY)**

#### 1. Semaphore Lifecycle Tracking
```python
# Add to src/daemon/middleware/semaphores.py
class SemaphoreTracker:
    """Track semaphore acquisition/release with full context."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.acquisitions = {}  # {id: {thread, timestamp, stack}}
        self.releases = {}
        
    async def track_acquire(self, sem_id, name):
        import traceback
        self.acquisitions[sem_id] = {
            "name": name,
            "timestamp": time.time(),
            "stack": traceback.format_stack()
        }
        logger.debug(f"[SEM_TRACK] Acquired {name} (id={sem_id})")
        
    async def track_release(self, sem_id, name):
        if sem_id in self.acquisitions:
            duration = time.time() - self.acquisitions[sem_id]["timestamp"]
            logger.debug(f"[SEM_TRACK] Released {name} after {duration:.2f}s")
            self.releases[sem_id] = time.time()
        else:
            logger.error(f"[SEM_TRACK] LEAK: Release without acquire for {name}")
```

#### 2. Expert Analysis Performance Profiling
```python
# Add to tools/workflow/expert_analysis.py
async def _call_expert_analysis_with_profiling(self, ...):
    checkpoints = {}
    
    # Checkpoint 1: Start
    checkpoints["start"] = time.time()
    
    # Checkpoint 2: Prompt building
    prompt = self._build_expert_prompt(...)
    checkpoints["prompt_built"] = time.time()
    logger.info(f"[EXPERT_PROFILE] Prompt size: {len(prompt)} chars")
    
    # Checkpoint 3: API call
    response = await provider.generate_content(...)
    checkpoints["api_complete"] = time.time()
    
    # Checkpoint 4: Response parsing
    result = json.loads(response.content)
    checkpoints["parsed"] = time.time()
    
    # Log timing breakdown
    total = checkpoints["parsed"] - checkpoints["start"]
    prompt_time = checkpoints["prompt_built"] - checkpoints["start"]
    api_time = checkpoints["api_complete"] - checkpoints["prompt_built"]
    parse_time = checkpoints["parsed"] - checkpoints["api_complete"]
    
    logger.info(
        f"[EXPERT_PROFILE] Total: {total:.2f}s "
        f"(prompt: {prompt_time:.2f}s, api: {api_time:.2f}s, parse: {parse_time:.2f}s)"
    )
```

#### 3. Infinite Loop Detection
```python
# Add to tools/workflow/orchestration.py
class LoopDetector:
    """Detect and prevent infinite loops in workflow tools."""
    
    def __init__(self, max_iterations=50):
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations
        self.iteration_count = 0
        self.last_state = None
        self.stagnation_count = 0
        
    def check_iteration(self, current_state):
        self.iteration_count += 1
        
        # Check max iterations
        if self.iteration_count >= self.max_iterations:
            raise RuntimeError(f"Max iterations ({self.max_iterations}) exceeded")
        
        # Check state stagnation
        if current_state == self.last_state:
            self.stagnation_count += 1
            if self.stagnation_count >= 3:
                logger.warning(f"State stagnant for {self.stagnation_count} iterations")
        else:
            self.stagnation_count = 0
            
        self.last_state = current_state
        
        # Log progress
        if self.iteration_count % 10 == 0:
            logger.info(f"[LOOP_DETECT] Iteration {self.iteration_count}/{self.max_iterations}")
```

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### **Immediate (Today)**
1. ‚úÖ Create this investigation document
2. ‚è≥ Implement diagnostic infrastructure (semaphore tracking, profiling, loop detection)
3. ‚è≥ Run system and collect actual error logs
4. ‚è≥ Profile expert analysis to find real bottleneck

### **Short-term (This Week)**
1. Verify _inflight_reqs cleanup implementation
2. Test workflow tool circuit breaker behavior
3. Monitor semaphore health in running system
4. Create updated roadmap based on ACTUAL issues

### **Long-term (Next Week)**
1. Address real performance bottlenecks (not theoretical ones)
2. Implement comprehensive monitoring
3. Create production readiness checklist based on reality

## Lessons Learned

1. **Documentation Drift is Dangerous** - Roadmaps created from analysis can become outdated quickly
2. **Verify Before Fixing** - Always check if "critical bugs" actually exist in current code
3. **Observe, Don't Assume** - Run the system and observe real failures instead of fixing theoretical issues
4. **EXAI is Valuable** - Critical analysis revealed we were on the wrong track
5. **User Intuition Matters** - User's concern about "timeouts as default suggestion" was spot-on

## Status: READY FOR DIAGNOSTIC IMPLEMENTATION

Next action: Implement Phase 1 diagnostic infrastructure to enable observation-driven development.
