# Phase 1.3: request_handler.py Refactoring - IN PROGRESS

**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (70% Complete)  
**Started**: 2025-09-30  
**Target**: 1,345 lines â†’ ~95 lines (93% reduction)

## âœ… Completed Work

### Modules Created (5/7)

1. **request_handler_init.py** (200 lines) âœ…
   - Environment setup and configuration
   - Import management (lazy imports)
   - Tool registry building
   - Request ID generation
   - Monitoring configuration setup

2. **request_handler_routing.py** (145 lines) âœ…
   - Tool name normalization
   - Thinking tool aliasing (deepthink â†’ thinkdeep)
   - Client filtering (placeholder)
   - Unknown tool suggestions (difflib)

3. **request_handler_model_resolution.py** (280 lines) âœ…
   - Centralized auto routing policy
   - Step-aware heuristics for workflows
   - CJK content detection
   - Intelligent selection by tool category
   - Provider validation and fallback

4. **request_handler_context.py** (210 lines) âœ…
   - Thread context reconstruction
   - Session cache integration
   - Continuation ID management
   - Consensus auto-model selection

5. **request_handler_monitoring.py** (165 lines) âœ…
   - Execute with monitor wrapper
   - Watchdog and heartbeat implementation
   - Timeout handling

## ðŸ”„ Remaining Work

### Modules to Create (2/7)

6. **request_handler_execution.py** (NEXT)
   - Tool execution orchestration
   - Kimi/GLM fallback handling
   - Result normalization
   - File size validation
   - Model context creation

7. **request_handler_post_processing.py** (NEXT)
   - Files required to continue handling
   - Auto-continue workflows
   - Progress attachment
   - Activity summary generation
   - Session cache write-back
   - Evidence tap (Kimi bridge tracing)

### Main File Refactoring (NEXT)
8. **request_handler.py** - Refactor to thin orchestrator (~95 lines)
   - Import from all modules
   - Delegate to specialized functions
   - Maintain public API
   - Preserve backward compatibility

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Strategy

### Pragmatic Approach (Recommended by EXAI)

**Phase 1: Structural Refactoring** (Current)
- Create stub modules with function signatures
- Refactor main file to delegate to stubs
- Stubs initially contain inline implementations
- Achieve 93% reduction goal
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility

**Phase 2: Progressive Migration** (Future)
- Move implementation details from stubs to modules
- Remove inline code as functions are fully migrated
- Iterative improvement while maintaining functionality

### Benefits
- âœ… Immediate structural improvement
- âœ… Risk mitigation (no breaking changes)
- âœ… Team can work with modular structure immediately
- âœ… Clear path for continued refinement

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

- [ ] All 7 helper modules created
- [ ] Main file reduced to ~95 lines
- [ ] 100% backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Server restarts successfully
- [ ] All existing functionality works
- [ ] EXAI QA validation: VERY_HIGH confidence
- [ ] Zero breaking changes

## ðŸ“Š Metrics

**Current Progress**:
- Modules Created: 5/7 (71%)
- Lines Extracted: ~1,000 lines
- Estimated Remaining: ~250 lines to extract
- Main File Target: ~95 lines

**Expected Final Metrics**:
- Original: 1,345 lines
- Refactored: ~95 lines (main) + ~1,000 lines (modules)
- Reduction: 93%
- Modules: 8 total (7 helpers + 1 main)
