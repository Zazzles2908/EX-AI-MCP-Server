### API Documentation Review

#### Expected Behavior of `thinkdeep` vs. Minimal/Incorrect Server Integration

Expected Behavior:
- `thinkdeep` is designed for multi-step, structured reasoning tasks.
- It expects to receive a JSON payload with fields like `step`, `step_number`, `total_steps`, and `findings`.
- It should support streaming responses, allowing partial results to be sent back incrementally.
- It should handle large inputs/outputs gracefully, possibly through staged file loading and size budgeting.

Minimal/Incorrect Server Integration:
- Schema Mismatch: If the server does not strictly enforce the JSON Schema draft-07 with `additionalProperties: false`, it might accept malformed requests, leading to unexpected behavior or timeouts.
- Lack of Streaming Support: If the server does not support streaming responses, it might attempt to process and send the entire response at once, causing timeouts for large responses.
- Incorrect File Handling: If the server does not correctly resolve files under `TEST_FILES_DIR` or exceeds size limits, it could lead to failures or timeouts.
- Insufficient Timeout Handling: If the server does not implement proper timeout handling for long-running tasks, it might not return any response within the expected timeframe.

### Script/Daemon Review (Conceptual)

Common Failure Points in WS Daemon Implementations
1. Timeout Handling:
   - Issue: If the daemon does not properly handle timeouts for long-running tasks, it might not return any response.
   - Symptom: No response from the daemon, leading to a timeout.
   - Solution: Implement proper timeout handling with graceful cancellation and partial result delivery.

2. Max Message Size:
   - Issue: If the daemon has a low max message size limit, it might fail to send large responses.
   - Symptom: No response or partial response.
   - Solution: Increase the max message size limit and implement chunked responses.

3. Backpressure/Streaming Handling:
   - Issue: If the daemon does not handle backpressure correctly, it might overwhelm the client or itself.
   - Symptom: No response or partial response.
   - Solution: Implement backpressure handling and support for streaming responses.

4. Dispatch Logic (Queueing, Worker Pool, Cancellation):
   - Issue: If the daemon does not properly manage its worker pool or queue, it might fail to process tasks in a timely manner.
   - Symptom: No response or delayed response.
   - Solution: Implement a robust dispatch logic with cooperative cancellation and prioritization.

### Architecture Review

Execution Pipeline and Potential Bottlenecks
1. Schema Validation:
   - Bottleneck: Misconfiguration in schema validation could lead to accepting invalid requests.
   - Solution: Ensure strict schema validation with `additionalProperties: false`.

2. File Resolution:
   - Bottleneck: Incorrect file resolution or exceeding size limits.
   - Solution: Implement file size budgeting and staged file loading.

3. Model Routing/Dispatch:
   - Bottleneck: Inefficient dispatch logic or insufficient worker pool.
   - Solution: Optimize dispatch logic with cooperative cancellation and worker pool management.

4. Provider Call:
   - Bottleneck: Long-running provider calls without proper timeout handling.
   - Solution: Implement timeouts and partial result delivery.

5. Response Serialization:
   - Bottleneck: Large responses causing serialization delays.
   - Solution: Implement chunked responses and progressive streaming.

6. WS Send:
   - Bottleneck: Network issues or large message sizes.
   - Solution: Implement backpressure handling and increase max message size limit.

### Alternative Solutions (Root-Cause-Oriented)

1. Increase Max Message Size (daemon): High impact; Medium effort.
2. Turn on Streaming for thinkdeep: High impact; Medium effort.
3. Optimize Worker Pool / Dispatch: Medium impact; Medium effort.
4. File Size Budgeting & Staged Loading: Medium impact; Medium effort.
5. Partial Result Envelopes: Medium impact; Medium effort.
6. Add Watchdog Instrumentation (timing spans, in-flight counters): Medium impact; Low effort.

- Consultation captured via EXAI-WS MCP; raw content preserved above.
- Prioritize root-cause-first solutions (streaming, message size limits, dispatch/backpressure) before simply raising timeouts.
