# Kimi websearch smoke test 3 (after parser hardening)

Prompt:
- Use web search to find the official Moonshot tool-use documentation URL and list three relevant URLs.

Raw tool response:

<raw>
(Empty body returned again.)
</raw>

Note:
- Still empty. Next step: instrument parser to capture the exact raw choices[0].message object under an env flag to diagnose provider shape.
