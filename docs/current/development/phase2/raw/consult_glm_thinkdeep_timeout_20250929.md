# thinkdeep Timeout Analysis & Debugging Plan

## 1. Likely Root Causes

Primary Suspects:
- Processing complexity: thinkdeep likely performs more intensive reasoning than other tools, hitting processing timeouts
- Response size limits: thinkdeep responses may exceed WebSocket message size limits
- File handling overhead: TEST_FILES_DIR resolver combined with thinkdeep's file analysis may be resource-intensive

Secondary Considerations:
- Schema validation overhead with strict JSON (draft-07, additionalProperties:false)
- Memory pressure during complex reasoning steps
- WebSocket connection state management differences

## 2. Fast Debugging Plan

Phase 1: Isolate the Component
{"step": "test", "step_number": 1, "total_steps": 1, "next_step_required": false, "findings": "test"}

Phase 2: File System Analysis
- Check file sizes in TEST_FILES_DIR
- Monitor memory usage during thinkdeep execution
- Test with single small file vs. multiple large files

Phase 3: Protocol Validation
- Enable debug logging on WebSocket daemon
- Capture raw thinkdeep requests/responses
- Compare response sizes with working tools

## 3. Config Adjustments

Critical Settings to Check:
- Increase WebSocket timeout (likely 30s â†’ 120s+)
- Raise max message size limits (check daemon config)
- Enable streaming for thinkdeep responses
- Adjust memory limits for reasoning processes

Red Flags to Check Immediately:
- Any "memory exceeded" or "response too large" logs
- WebSocket disconnect patterns specific to thinkdeep
- File resolver performance metrics

## 4. thinkdeep Special Requirements

Key Differences from Other Tools:
- Requires sustained reasoning state across steps
- Processes larger context windows
- May generate more complex response structures
- Likely benefits from streaming responses

Recommendations:
- Implement progressive response streaming for thinkdeep
- Add chunked file processing for large inputs
- Consider caching intermediate reasoning results
