# Kimi websearch smoke test 4 (debug trace on)

Prompt:
- Use web search to find the official Moonshot tool-use documentation URL and list three relevant URLs.
- debug_trace=true

Raw tool response:

<raw>
(Empty body)
</raw>

Observation:
- The EXAI-WS tool call returned an empty body even with debug_trace=true. This suggests the emptiness is happening at the tool bridge layer, not inside our Kimi server tool implementation (which returns JSON strings for all branches).
- Next step: I will run a direct non-websearch Kimi chat via the same MCP tool to confirm the tool bridge output path, and then run a direct server-side unit call to the Kimi provider to capture raw JSON locally for evidence.
