## 0) Summary
- Workspace: EX-AI MCP Server (WS daemon active)
- Overall status: Core chat/capabilities/diagnostics are operational; workflow tools are available and strict-schema validated; continuation flow fixed and tested; file-context auto-provision integrated.
- Summary stats (approximate):
  - Total tool modules discovered: 33+
  - Operational now: 20–24 (core + providers + most diagnostics + capabilities + chat)
  - Partially operational (strict inputs, needs E2E): 8–12 (workflow tools)
  - Non-operational: 0 known blockers at this time
- Key evidence:
  - docs/augmentcode_phase2/raw/continuation_unit_test_*.json (chat continuation OK)
  - docs/augmentcode_phase2/raw/phase3_ws_chat_turn1*.json, phase3_ws_chat_turn2*.json
  - docs/augmentcode_phase2/raw/phase3_schema_consultation_exai_chat.md

## 1) Environment Configuration Review

Findings (no secrets printed):
- Provider keys
  - KIMI_API_KEY: PRESENT
  - GLM_API_KEY: PRESENT
- Provider URLs
  - KIMI_API_URL=https://api.moonshot.ai/v1
  - GLM_API_URL=https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4
- Defaults
  - DEFAULT_MODEL=glm-4.5-flash (good)
  - ROUTER_ENABLED=true (routing enabled)
- Streaming
  - GLM_STREAM_ENABLED=true; KIMI_STREAM_ENABLED=true (env-gated streaming enabled)
- Test files
  - TEST_FILES_DIR=C:\\Project\\EX-AI-MCP-Server\\test_files (exists, sample files present)
- Web search
  - EX_WEB_ENABLED=true; EX_WEB_PROVIDERS=glm,kimi
- WS daemon
  - EXAI_WS_CALL_TIMEOUT=180; no explicit port set in .env (daemon started fine on default per script)
- GitHub MCP and Supabase blocks present (not used in current validations)

Assessment:
- Environment is sufficiently configured for GLM and Kimi operations, streaming, and local file tests.
- No blocking misconfiguration detected.

Recommendations:
- Optional: add EXAI_WS_HOST/EXAI_WS_PORT to .env to make daemon port explicit (matches .env.example).
- Optional: review long block of nonessential Supabase variables for this phase to reduce noise.

## 3) Detailed Status by Tool/Type

Legend: [OK]=operational; [PARTIAL]=operational with caveats; [TBD]=not exercised in this pass

### Core
- chat [OK]
  - Purpose: General chat; supports continuation and file-based large prompt ingestion
  - Params: prompt, model, continuation_id, files, use_websearch, stream
  - Validation: Two-turn continuation unit test saved under docs/augmentcode_phase2/raw/continuation_unit_test_*.json; WS smoke shows handling of large prompt with RESEND_PROMPT guidance
- version [OK]
  - Purpose: Server/version info
  - Validation: WS smoke returned formatted version content
- challenge [OK]
  - Purpose: Critical-analysis helper; schema normalized (draft-07 + additionalProperties:false)
- activity/selfcheck/models/registry [TBD]
  - Purpose: Internal helpers/utilities; no issues observed in this pass

### Capabilities
- listmodels [OK]
  - Purpose: Enumerate available models
  - Schema: draft-07 + additionalProperties:false
- provider_capabilities [OK]
  - Purpose: Capability surface per provider/model
  - Schema: normalized
- version [OK]
  - Purpose: Capabilities version descriptor
  - Schema: normalized
- models/recommend [TBD]
  - Purpose: Internal model mapping/recommendations

### Diagnostics
- health [OK]
  - Purpose: Health-signal (log tail, basic readiness)
  - Schema: normalized
- status [OK]
  - Purpose: Node/process/WS quick status
- ws_daemon_smoke [OK]
  - Purpose: End-to-end WS sanity test; completed successfully in this pass
- ping_activity/toolcall_log_tail/diagnose_ws_stack/batch_markdown_reviews [TBD]

### Workflows (EXAI)
- thinkdeep [PARTIAL]
  - Purpose: Multi-stage deep analysis
  - Behavior: Strict input validation; requires findings (and sometimes files); previously returned files_required_to_continue
  - Fixes: Auto-provision path added in request handler; resolver integrates TEST_FILES_DIR; needs WS E2E verification
- analyze/codereview/debug/refactor/docgen/precommit/secaudit/testgen/tracer/consensus/planner [PARTIAL]
  - Purpose: Workflow tools; rely on strict schemas and may request file context
  - Status: Available and loadable; end-to-end under WS should function with new file-context resolver; not all were executed in this pass

### Provider-specific
- GLM
  - glm_web_search [OK]
  - glm_files/glm_files_cleanup/glm_payload_preview [TBD]
- Kimi
  - kimi_chat_with_tools (via providers) [OK]
  - kimi_upload_and_extract [OK pending file tests]
  - kimi_intent_analysis/kimi_files_cleanup/kimi_capture_headers [TBD]

Evidence references:
- WS restart/register log (terminal output)
- docs/augmentcode_phase2/raw/phase3_ws_chat_turn1*.json, turn2*.json

## 4) Work Required Analysis (Prioritized)

Severity: Critical
1. Workflow E2E validation with file auto-provision
   - Tools: thinkdeep, analyze, codereview, debug, refactor, docgen, precommit, secaudit, testgen, tracer
   - Task: Run one end-to-end per tool with a small scenario; confirm files_required_to_continue auto-resolves via TEST_FILES_DIR globs
   - Effort: 0.5–1.5 days (batch)
   - Dependencies: TEST_FILES_DIR populated (done); server running (done)

Severity: High
2. Argument strictness guards in client path
   - Tools: thinkdeep (requires findings), other workflows with required fields
   - Task: Ensure client/request builders always include required fields (even as empty strings) to satisfy strict schemas
   - Effort: 2–4 hours

3. Instrumentation for model resolution (env-gated)
   - Task: Add structured logs around boundary resolution and selection; include continuation path markers
   - Effort: 2–3 hours

Severity: Medium
4. Provider tool mini-smokes
   - Tools: kimi_upload_and_extract (use TEST_FILES_DIR samples), glm_web_search (already OK)
   - Task: Add small scripted checks; capture raw artifacts under docs/augmentcode_phase2/raw
   - Effort: 2–4 hours

5. Docs: Schema policy and evolution
   - Task: Author concise doc explaining draft-07, additionalProperties:false, and how SchemaBuilder/WorkflowSchemaBuilder enforce consistency; add examples
   - Effort: 2–3 hours

Severity: Low
6. Make WS host/port explicit in .env (optional)
   - Effort: 15 minutes

7. CI smoke (local)
   - Task: Wire scripts/diagnostics/test_continuation.py into a quick CI job; non-networking by default
   - Effort: 1 hour

---

## 5) Actionable Recommendations
- Proceed with E2E workflow smokes leveraging TEST_FILES_DIR and the new resolver to validate files_required_to_continue handling in real WS calls.
- Add client-side argument fillers for strict schema fields (e.g., findings), to avoid immediate validation failures.
- Capture all raw outputs for each validation under docs/augmentcode_phase2/raw and update evidence index.
- Optionally, set EXAI_WS_HOST/EXAI_WS_PORT in .env to standardize local dev.

---

## 6) Appendix – Notable Changes Implemented
- Continuation auto-mode hardening at WS boundary and in reconstruction path (maps 'auto' → concrete model for token/cap calc).
- Fixed duration measuring to include orchestration time.
- File context resolver integrated (src/server/utils/file_context_resolver.py) and wired into files_required_to_continue.
- Strict schema normalization on capabilities/diagnostics/challenge tools (draft-07 + additionalProperties:false).
- Unit test harness for continuation saved under docs/augmentcode_phase2/raw.
