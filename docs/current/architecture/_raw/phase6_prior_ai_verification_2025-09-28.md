# Phase 6 – Prior AI Work Verification (2025-09-28)

## Sources reviewed
- Prior AI task list: __2025-09-28T09-35-01.md
- Checklist: docs/System_layout/task-manager-implementation-checklist.md
- Kimi streaming doc: docs/System_layout/API_platforms/Kimi/streaming/streaming_fixed.md
- GLM streaming doc: docs/System_layout/API_platforms/GLM/streaming/streaming.md

## Findings
- Checklist shows Phase 6 entries for streaming:
  - [x] Kimi streaming (env-gated) – Marked complete
  - [x] GLM streaming (env-gated) – Marked complete
- Kimi streaming doc status = Missing/Incomplete; indicates env-gated path not enabled by default.
- Runtime probe: `ws_probe.py` → Kimi streaming tool missing (`Unknown tool: kimi_chat_with_tools`), confirming incomplete implementation/exposure.
- .env was missing `KIMI_STREAM_ENABLED` prior to this run, so earlier claimed tests did not enable Kimi streaming.

## Conclusion
- GLM streaming: consistent with docs (✅) and validated by probe artifacts.
- Kimi streaming: incorrectly marked complete; remains incomplete/unexposed. Requires code + registry updates.

## Next steps
- Implement env-gated streaming in src/providers/kimi.py, mirror GLM aggregation pattern.
- Expose a Kimi streaming tool (e.g., kimi_chat_with_tools or stream_demo provider=moonshot) via tools/registry.
- Re-run streaming validations and update checklist marks.
