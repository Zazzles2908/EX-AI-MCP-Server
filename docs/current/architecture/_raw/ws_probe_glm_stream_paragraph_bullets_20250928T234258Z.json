This approach reduces perceived latency, making applications feel more responsive and engaging while users can begin interacting with content as soon as it becomes available.\\n\\n• Improved perceived performance: Users see content appearing immediately, creating a faster and more responsive experience even when backend processing takes time.\\n• Better user engagement: Content consumption can begin before the entire response is delivered, keeping users engaged and reducing bounce rates.\\n• Reduced resource usage: Both client and server resources are optimized as data is transmitted in chunks rather than as a single large payload.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAGENT'S TURN: Evaluate this perspective alongside your analysis to form a comprehensive solution and continue with the user's request and task at hand.\", \"content_type\": \"text\", \"metadata\": {\"tool_name\": \"chat\", \"conversation_ready\": true, \"model_used\": \"glm-4.5-flash\", \"provider_used\": \"glm\", \"progress\": [\"chat: Starting execution\", \"chat: Request validated\", \"chat: Model/context ready: glm-4.5-flash\", \"chat: Generating response (~1,656 tokens)\"]}, \"continuation_offer\": {\"continuation_id\": \"c71de4b7-371e-418b-93e3-2940585024f5\", \"note\": \"Claude can continue this conversation for 19 more exchanges.\", \"remaining_turns\": 19}}"
