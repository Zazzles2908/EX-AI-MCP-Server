2. **WebSocket Stability Issues Identified** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - 15 connection errors during 5 rounds (3 errors per round average)
   - Pattern: Errors occur after long-running responses (145s, 148s, 87s)
   - Impact: Non-critical but affects user experience

3. **Supabase Performance is Excellent** ‚úÖ
   - All HTTP/2 201 Created responses successful
   - 3-4 calls per turn (GET conversations, GET messages, POST messages)
   - No errors or timeouts detected

4. **System is Production-Ready with Enhancements** üöÄ
   - Core functionality working correctly
   - Requires: WebSocket resilience, batching, enhanced monitoring
   - Recommended: 2-week implementation roadmap provided

## Round-by-Round Analysis

### Round 1: Strategic Analysis (Duration: 59.4s)
**Focus:** GLM web search implementation strategy validation

**EXAI's Assessment:**
- ‚úÖ Text format handler is a **pragmatic solution** for current needs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Adds ~40 tokens per search (~$0.12/year for 1000 searches)
- üìä Recommended provider capability matrix for automatic routing

**Key Recommendations:**
1. **Short-term:** Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
2. **Medium-term:** Create abstraction layer for tool execution
3. **Long-term:** Implement provider selection based on capabilities

**System Observations:**
- Supabase: 3 successful HTTP/2 201 Created calls
- WebSocket: No errors during this round
- Conversation continuity: Working perfectly (turn 9)

---

### Round 2: Cost-Effectiveness Deep Dive (Duration: 145.5s)
**Focus:** Token cost analysis and implementation details

**EXAI's Detailed Analysis:**

**Token Cost Breakdown:**
```
GLM-4.6 Tool Call Format:
<TOOL_CALL>{"name": "web_search", "arguments": "{\"query\": \"test\"}"}</TOOL_CALL>
Estimated: ~40 tokens

Annual Cost (1000 searches):
40 tokens √ó 1000 searches √ó $0.0015/1K tokens = $0.06
DuckDuckGo API calls: ~$0.06 (rate limiting concern)
Total: ~$0.12/year
```

**Comprehensive Code Examples Provided:**
1. **Provider Capability Matrix** - Automatic routing based on query type
2. **GLM Monitoring System** - Metrics tracking for format detection
3. **ToolExecutor Abstraction** - Unified interface for tool execution
4. **Session Tracking Schema** - Database design for sessions and turns
5. **AsyncSupabaseManager Batching** - Queue-based write optimization

**System Observations:**
- Supabase: 2 successful HTTP/2 201 Created calls
- WebSocket: **5 connection errors** after response completion
- Response time: 145.5s (long-running, triggered WebSocket timeouts)
- Conversation continuity: Working (turn 12)

---

### Round 3: System Integration & Performance (Duration: 87.2s)
**Focus:** Supabase schema integration and Week 2 architecture

**EXAI's Integration Strategy:**

**Schema Design Decision:**
- **Keep sessions and conversations SEPARATE but related**
- Sessions = high-level tracking (user, provider, cost, performance)
- Conversations = detailed message history (continuation_id based)
- Link via: `conversations.session_id ‚Üí sessions.session_id`

**Batching Strategy:**
```python
High-frequency writes (sessions, turns) ‚Üí Queue for batching
Low-frequency writes (conversations) ‚Üí Immediate write
Critical reads ‚Üí Wait for pending writes before reading
```

**Real-time Monitoring Integration:**
- WebSocket-based dashboard for live metrics
- Provider routing with mid-conversation switching
- Search result caching in Redis (reduce redundant searches)

**System Observations:**
- Supabase: 3 successful HTTP/2 201 Created calls
- WebSocket: **5 connection errors** after response completion
- Response time: 87.2s (moderate duration)
- Conversation continuity: Working (turn 15)

## Implementation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Today)

1. **Enhance WebSocket Error Handling**
   ```python
   # Add to src/monitoring/ws_server.py
   async def _safe_send(self, connection_id: str, message: dict) -> bool:
       try:
           if connection_id in self.active_connections:
               await self.active_connections[connection_id].send_text(json.dumps(message))
               return True
           return False
       except Exception as e:
           logger.error(f"[WEBSOCKET] ERROR in _safe_send - {e}")
           # Store critical messages for retry
           if message.get("critical", False):
               self._store_pending_message(connection_id, message)
           return False
   ```
