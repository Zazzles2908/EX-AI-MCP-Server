### Vision

**From**: Static tool-routing system with isolated prompts  
**To**: Dynamic, AI Manager-enhanced intelligent system with collaborative prompts

### Key Deliverables

1. **AI Manager System Prompt Redesign** - Complete architectural proposal
2. **Documentation Reorganization Plan** - Professional structure for all docs
3. **Implementation Roadmap** - Step-by-step execution plan

## 📊 CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### System Prompts

**Problems**:
- ✗ 13 static, isolated system prompts
- ✗ 70% duplication of common instructions
- ✗ No AI Manager integration
- ✗ Tool-centric design (not workflow-centric)
- ✗ Manager underutilized (only routes, doesn't enhance)

**Current Structure**:
```
systemprompts/
├── chat_prompt.py (77 lines)
├── thinkdeep_prompt.py (69 lines)
├── analyze_prompt.py (91 lines)
├── ... (10 more files)
└── Total: ~1,000 lines with 70% duplication
```

### Documentation

**Problems**:
- ✗ Scattered across multiple folders
- ✗ No clear hierarchy or navigation
- ✗ Outdated content mixed with current
- ✗ Poor discoverability
- ✗ Inconsistent naming and structure

**Current Structure**:
```
docs/current/
├── architecture/ (mixed old/new)
├── development/ (phase docs scattered)
├── policies/ (single file)
├── reviews/ (historical)
└── tools/ (flat list of 15 files)
```

## 🏗️ PROPOSED TRANSFORMATION

### 1. AI Manager System Prompt Redesign

#### 3-Layer Architecture

**Layer 1: AI Manager Core Prompt**
- **Purpose**: Define manager as intelligent micro-agent
- **File**: `systemprompts/manager_prompt.py`
- **Responsibilities**:
  * Context analysis and enrichment
  * Parameter validation and optimization
  * Intelligent routing suggestions
  * Progress monitoring and intervention
  * Error recovery and retry logic
  * Result enhancement

**Layer 2: Shared Prompt Components**
- **Purpose**: Eliminate duplication with reusable components
- **File**: `systemprompts/prompt_components.py`
- **Components**:
  * LINE_NUMBER_INSTRUCTIONS
  * FILES_REQUIRED_PROTOCOL
  * TOOL_AWARENESS_SECTION
  * ESCALATION_GUIDANCE
  * COLLABORATION_HEADER

**Layer 3: Tool-Specific Prompts (Simplified)**
- **Purpose**: Focus on tool's core purpose only
- **Files**: 13 refactored prompt files
- **Structure**: Dynamic assembly from shared components
- **Size**: 60-70% smaller than current

#### AI Manager Workflow

```
Request → Analyze → Enrich → Validate → Monitor → Enhance → Respond
```

**Manager Intelligence Examples**:

1. **Parameter Optimization**
   - Detects missing file paths
   - Suggests relevant files based on context
   - Adds thinking_mode based on complexity

2. **Intelligent Routing**
   - Analyzes request intent
   - Suggests better tools when appropriate
   - Explains why alternative is better

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Detects error patterns
   - Identifies missing context
   - Automatically retries with enrichment

4. **Progress Monitoring**
   - Tracks multi-step workflows
   - Maintains context between steps
   - Suggests next logical steps

#### Expected Benefits

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Total Prompt Lines** | ~1,000 | ~300 | 70% reduction |
| **Duplication** | 70% | 0% | 100% elimination |
| **Manager Utilization** | 10% | 90% | 9x increase |
| **Maintainability** | Low | High | Significant |
| **Extensibility** | Medium | High | Improved |

### 2. Documentation Reorganization

#### New Structure

```
docs/current/
├── 1_getting_started/      (NEW - onboarding)
├── 2_architecture/          (REORGANIZED - system design)
├── 3_tools/                 (REORGANIZED - categorized tools)
├── 4_guides/                (NEW - how-to guides)
├── 5_reference/             (NEW - API & config reference)
├── 6_development/           (REORGANIZED - dev docs)
└── archive/                 (NEW - historical content)
```

#### Key Improvements

1. **Numbered Sections**
   - Clear reading order
   - Progressive complexity
   - Easy navigation

2. **Categorized Tools**
   - Workflow tools (analyze, thinkdeep, codereview, etc.)
   - Planning tools (planner, consensus, tracer)
   - Utility tools (chat, docgen, challenge, etc.)

3. **Getting Started Section**
   - Quick start guide
   - Installation instructions
   - Configuration guide
   - First steps tutorial

4. **Guides Section**
   - Workflow patterns
   - Best practices
   - Advanced techniques

5. **Reference Section**
   - API documentation
   - Configuration reference
   - Troubleshooting guide

6. **Archive**
   - Historical phase docs
   - Old architecture
   - Completed reviews

#### Expected Benefits

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Discoverability** | Low | High | Significant |
| **Organization** | Poor | Excellent | Major |
| **Onboarding Time** | 2 hours | 30 minutes | 75% reduction |
| **Maintenance** | Difficult | Easy | Significant |
