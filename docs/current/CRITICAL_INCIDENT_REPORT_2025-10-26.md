# CRITICAL INCIDENT REPORT - System Breakdown
**Date:** 2025-10-26 09:23-09:26 AEDT  
**Severity:** CRITICAL üö®  
**Status:** ACTIVE - System Unstable

---

## üö® **INCIDENT SUMMARY**

Multiple critical failures occurred simultaneously when attempting EXAI consultation:

1. **Massive asyncio socket failures** (hundreds of warnings)
2. **WebSocket connection timeouts** (keepalive ping timeout)
3. **Wrong provider routing** (GLM instead of Kimi)
4. **Connection drops** (272s duration, unregistering)
5. **Retry loops** (OpenAI client retrying failed requests)

---

## üìä **TIMELINE**

```
09:23:52 - Hundreds of asyncio socket.send() warnings
09:23:52 - Connection unregistered (272.54s duration)
09:23:52 - New connection established
09:23:52 - chat tool called with continuation_id
09:23:53 - Request sent to Kimi API
09:24:36 - HTTP Request to Z.ai (WRONG PROVIDER!)
09:25:08 - OpenAI client retrying (0.463s delay)
09:26:23 - OpenAI client retrying again (0.809s delay)
```

---

## üîç **ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED**

### 1. **Asyncio Socket Failures** üö®
**Symptoms:**
```
2025-10-26 09:23:52 WARNING asyncio: socket.send() raised exception.
[Repeated hundreds of times]
```

**Likely Causes:**
- WebSocket connection broken/unstable
- Network buffer overflow
- Too many concurrent connections
- Connection pool exhaustion

**Impact:** System unable to send data over sockets

---

### 2. **WebSocket Timeout** üö®
**Error:**
```
sent 1011 (internal error) keepalive ping timeout; no close frame received
```

**Likely Causes:**
- EXAI took too long to respond
- Network latency spike
- Server overload
- Keepalive timeout too aggressive

**Impact:** First EXAI call failed completely

---

### 3. **Wrong Provider Routing** üö®
**Expected:** Kimi (kimi-k2-0905-preview)
**Actual:** GLM (Z.ai API)

**Evidence:**
```
INFO:src.providers.openai_compatible: chat.completions.create payload (sanitized): {"model": "kimi-k2-0905-preview"...
INFO:httpx: HTTP Request: POST https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
```

**Problem:** Model registry routing Kimi model to GLM provider!

**Impact:** Wrong API called, wrong behavior, potential errors

---

### 4. **Retry Loops** üö®
**Evidence:**
```
INFO:openai._base_client: Retrying request to /chat/completions in 0.463285 seconds
INFO:openai._base_client: Retrying request to /chat/completions in 0.809875 seconds
```

**Likely Causes:**
- API rate limiting
- Network errors
- Timeout errors
- Server errors

**Impact:** Delays, resource waste, potential infinite loops

---

## üîß **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**

### Priority 1: Fix Provider Routing (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Kimi model being routed to GLM provider

**Investigation Needed:**
1. Check `src/providers/registry.py` - model name validation
2. Check `src/providers/kimi.py` - model name patterns
3. Check `src/providers/glm.py` - model name patterns
4. Verify provider priority order

**Expected Fix:**
```python
# In registry.py or kimi.py
KIMI_MODELS = [
    "kimi-k2-0905-preview",  # Must be recognized!
    "kimi-k2-0711-preview",
    "kimi-latest",
    ...
]
```

---

### Priority 2: Fix Asyncio Socket Failures (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Hundreds of socket.send() exceptions

**Investigation Needed:**
1. Check WebSocket connection pool size
2. Check concurrent connection limits
3. Check network buffer sizes
4. Check connection cleanup logic

**Potential Fixes:**
- Increase connection pool size
- Add connection pooling/reuse
- Implement backpressure handling
- Add circuit breaker pattern

---

### Priority 3: Fix WebSocket Timeouts (HIGH)
**Problem:** Keepalive ping timeout causing connection drops

**Investigation Needed:**
1. Check keepalive timeout settings
2. Check EXAI response times
3. Check network latency
4. Check server load

**Potential Fixes:**
- Increase keepalive timeout (currently too aggressive)
- Add timeout configuration to .env
- Implement progressive timeout backoff
- Add connection health monitoring

---

### Priority 4: Fix Retry Logic (MEDIUM)
**Problem:** OpenAI client retrying indefinitely

**Investigation Needed:**
1. Check retry configuration
2. Check max retry attempts
3. Check backoff strategy
4. Check error handling

**Potential Fixes:**
- Set max retry attempts (e.g., 3)
- Implement exponential backoff
- Add circuit breaker
- Improve error logging

---

## üìã **ORIGINAL ISSUES (Still Unresolved)**

### Issue 1: Debug Output Pollution
**Status:** NOT ADDRESSED (blocked by system failures)
**Problem:** 7MB file content in debug logs

### Issue 2: Database Tracking Failures
**Status:** NOT ADDRESSED (blocked by system failures)
**Problem:** Missing 'upload_method' column

### Issue 3: File Deduplication Missing
**Status:** NOT ADDRESSED (blocked by system failures)
**Problem:** No deduplication logic

### Issue 4: Dual-Upload Architecture
**Status:** NOT ADDRESSED (blocked by system failures)
**Question:** Is dual-upload correct?

---

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED RECOVERY PLAN**

### Phase 1: Stabilize System (IMMEDIATE)
1. **Restart Docker container** to clear connection pool
2. **Check provider registry** for Kimi model routing
3. **Increase WebSocket timeouts** in configuration
4. **Add connection pool limits** to prevent exhaustion

### Phase 2: Fix Provider Routing (URGENT)
1. Investigate why Kimi model routes to GLM
2. Fix model name validation in registry
3. Test with simple Kimi call
4. Verify routing works correctly

### Phase 3: Fix Connection Issues (HIGH)
1. Implement connection pooling
2. Add backpressure handling
3. Increase keepalive timeouts
4. Add connection health monitoring

### Phase 4: Address Original Issues (MEDIUM)
1. Fix debug output pollution
2. Fix database schema
3. Implement file deduplication
4. Review dual-upload architecture

## üìä **SYSTEM HEALTH STATUS**

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| WebSocket Connections | üî¥ CRITICAL | Socket failures, timeouts |
| Provider Routing | üî¥ CRITICAL | Wrong provider for Kimi |
| EXAI Integration | üî¥ CRITICAL | Timeouts, retries |
| Database Tracking | üü° DEGRADED | Schema issues |
| File Uploads | üü¢ WORKING | Uploads succeed despite issues |
| Supabase | üü¢ WORKING | 23 messages tracked |

---

## üö® **CRITICAL DECISION POINT**

**STOP ALL IMPLEMENTATION WORK**

The system is fundamentally unstable. We cannot proceed with:
- File deduplication
- Debug output fixes
- Database schema changes
- EXAI consultations

**MUST FIX FIRST:**
1. Provider routing (Kimi ‚Üí GLM bug)
2. WebSocket stability (socket failures)
3. Connection timeouts (keepalive)

**THEN RESUME:**
- Original implementation tasks
- EXAI consultations
- Testing and validation

---

## üìù **NEXT STEPS**

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Investigate provider routing bug
2. **IMMEDIATE:** Check Docker logs for more details
3. **IMMEDIATE:** Restart Docker container
4. **URGENT:** Fix Kimi model routing
5. **URGENT:** Test simple Kimi call
6. **HIGH:** Fix WebSocket stability
7. **MEDIUM:** Resume original tasks
