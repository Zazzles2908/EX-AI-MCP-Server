# Personal Roadmap (EX MCP)

Keep this simple. Aim for zero-cost and minimal steps.

## 1) Today
- Use local EX MCP (stdio) with Claude on desktop
- For phone: run remote_server locally + HTTPS tunnel

## 2) Near term (optional)
- Add a small VPS or Render/Railway free tier
- Point domain + TLS proxy (Caddy/NGINX)

## 3) Later (optional)
- Add provider keys you prefer (KIMI/GLM/OpenRouter)
- Add model restrictions + logging retention
- CI smoke tests (optional)
