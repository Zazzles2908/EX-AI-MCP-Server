# Supabase MCP Migration Plan - Hybrid Architecture
**Date:** 2025-10-22 (Updated after Phase B completion & research)
**EXAI Consultation:** Continuation ID 9222d725-b6cd-44f1-8406-274e5a3b3389
**Status:** Phase A ✅ Complete, Phase B ✅ Complete, Phase C 🔄 In Progress
**Architecture:** HYBRID (MCP for infrastructure, Python for file operations)

---

## 🎯 CRITICAL UPDATE: Hybrid Architecture Decision

**Discovery (2025-10-22):** After comprehensive research and EXAI validation, we determined that Supabase MCP provides:
- ✅ **Database operations** (execute_sql, migrations, schema management)
- ✅ **Bucket management** (create, configure, list buckets)
- ✅ **Database branching** (create, merge, test isolation)
- ✅ **Authentication, Edge Functions, Account management**
- ❌ **File operations** (upload, download, delete) - NOT AVAILABLE in MCP

**Validation:** Feature group "storage" IS enabled in configuration, but provides bucket-level operations only.

**Architecture Decision:** **HYBRID APPROACH**
```
MCP Layer: Database, buckets, configuration, branching
Python Layer: File upload, download, delete, listing
```

**EXAI Validation:** "Your hybrid approach is architecturally sound and likely the intended design pattern."

See: `docs/HYBRID_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_2025-10-22.md` for full analysis.

## Executive Summary

Supabase integration using a **hybrid architecture** enables optimal use of both MCP tools and Python client libraries. After comprehensive analysis with EXAI (including web research), we recommend **Scenario 3: Gradual Migration with Hybrid Implementation** to balance innovation with pragmatism.

**Key Decision:** Preserve valuable architectural patterns (Facade, Multi-provider) while leveraging MCP for infrastructure operations and Python for file operations.

## 1. COMPONENT DECISIONS

### KEEP (Valuable Patterns)
- ✅ **FileManagementFacade** (713 lines)
  - Rationale: Facade pattern provides abstraction boundary
  - Value: Enables future provider changes without system-wide impact
  
- ✅ **UnifiedFileManager** (572 lines)
  - Rationale: Multi-provider complexity handling
  - Value: Supports Kimi, GLM, and future providers
  
- ✅ **RolloutManager** (224 lines)
  - Rationale: Percentage-based rollout still useful
  - Value: Gradual feature rollout independent of database branching
  
- ✅ **Test Suite** (310 lines, 12/12 passing)
  - Rationale: Validates patterns, adapt for MCP
  - Value: Regression testing, quality assurance

### TRANSFORM (Hybrid Architecture)
- 🔄 **SupabaseStorageManager** (976 lines) → **KEEP for File Operations**
  - **UPDATED DECISION:** Keep Python client for file operations (upload/download/delete)
  - Migrate database operations to MCP (execute_sql, queries)
  - Hybrid approach: MCP for DB, Python for files
  - Rationale: MCP doesn't provide file-level storage operations

- 🔄 **Shadow Mode** (268 lines) → Database Branching
  - Database operations: Use MCP branching
  - File operations: Keep shadow mode validation
  - Hybrid approach reduces risk

- 🔄 **Backfill Scripts** (124 lines) → Archive as Reference
  - Complete current 2-file backfill with Docker
  - Archive scripts to scripts/archive/bulk_operations/
  - Use MCP for future bulk operations

### ARCHIVE (Preserve for Reference)
- 📦 **Docker Scripts** - Move to scripts/archive/bulk_operations/
- 📦 **Legacy Handlers** - Keep as examples, document MCP alternatives
- 📦 **Python Database Wrappers** - Preserve for learning/reference

### DELETE
- ❌ **None** - All code has learning/reference value
