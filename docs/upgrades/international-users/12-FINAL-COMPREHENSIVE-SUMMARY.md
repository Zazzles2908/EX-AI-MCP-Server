## üîç Critical Findings

### Finding #1: System Prompt Simplification MISSING ‚ö†Ô∏è

**What Was Missed:**
- No audit of current system prompts
- No simplification strategy
- No alignment with architecture
- No testing plan

**Why Critical:**
- System prompts are foundation of AI behavior
- Complex prompts = unpredictable behavior
- Simplified prompts = better reliability
- Architecture alignment = consistency

**Action Required:**
- Audit all system prompts (Task 0.3)
- Simplify based on principles (Task 0.4)
- Test simplified prompts
- Document changes

---

### Finding #2: Architecture Documentation MISSING ‚ö†Ô∏è

**What Was Missed:**
- No design philosophy document
- No architecture overview
- No design patterns explained
- No rationale for decisions

**Why Critical:**
- GitHub users need to understand design
- Contributors need architectural guidance
- Maintainers need design rationale
- Future changes need context

**Action Required:**
- Create design philosophy (Task 0.1)
- Create architecture overview (Task 0.2)
- Document patterns and decisions
- Add diagrams and examples

---

### Finding #3: Web Search Tool Autonomy CONFIRMED ‚úÖ

**What Was Discovered:**
- GLM has web_search tool available
- GLM chooses when to use it
- GLM often delegates to user
- This is consistent across all models

**Evidence:**
- Tested with glm-4.5-flash
- Tested with glm-4.5
- Tested with kimi-thinking-preview
- All showed same delegation behavior

**Implication:**
- Cannot force tool usage
- Query phrasing matters
- User expectations need management
- Documentation must explain this

---

### Finding #4: Model Quality Affects Analysis Depth ‚úÖ

**What Was Discovered:**
- glm-4.5-flash: Fast but less detailed
- glm-4.5: Slower but more comprehensive
- kimi-thinking-preview: Slowest but deepest

**Evidence:**
- Tested same queries with different models
- Higher quality = better analysis
- Higher quality = slower response
- Higher quality ‚â† different tool usage

**Implication:**
- Choose model based on task
- Document model selection guidance
- Set user expectations
- Balance speed vs quality
