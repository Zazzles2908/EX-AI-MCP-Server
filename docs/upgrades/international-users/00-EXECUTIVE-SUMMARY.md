# Executive Summary: zai-sdk Upgrade for International Users

**Date:** 2025-10-01  
**Target:** International/Overseas Users  
**SDK:** `zai-sdk` (NOT `zhipuai`)  
**API:** https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/  
**Status:** 🚧 BLOCKED - Critical issues must be resolved first

---

## 🎯 What We're Doing

Upgrading our EX-AI-MCP-Server from `zai-sdk>=0.0.3.3` to `zai-sdk==0.0.4` to support:
- **GLM-4.6** model (200K context, released Sept 30, 2025)
- **Video Generation** (CogVideoX-2, up to 4K, 60fps)
- **Assistant API** (structured conversations)
- **Character Role-Playing** (CharGLM-3)
- **Enhanced capabilities** for international users

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Finding #1: EXAI Native Web Search Not Working
**Severity:** 🔴 HIGH - BLOCKS RESEARCH  
**Issue:** The `chat_EXAI-WS` tool with `use_websearch=true` does NOT perform native web browsing  
**Impact:** Cannot use EXAI tools for autonomous research  
**Status:** Identified, needs immediate fix  
**Details:** See `01-scope-gaps-identified.md`

### Finding #2: Initial Research Was Inaccurate
**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM - BLOCKS IMPLEMENTATION  
**Issue:** Previous research contained major errors:
- Wrong SDK understanding (missed dual packages)
- Wrong GLM-4.6 release date (July vs Sept 30)
- Wrong context length (128K vs 200K)
- Missing major features (video, assistant, character RP)

**Impact:** Cannot proceed with implementation using wrong information  
**Status:** Corrections documented, rewrite needed  
**Details:** See `04-critical-corrections.md` and `05-summary-corrections.md`

### Finding #3: EXAI Tools Are Workflow-Based
**Severity:** 🟢 LOW - BY DESIGN  
**Issue:** EXAI workflow tools (analyze, thinkdeep) require manual investigation between steps  
**Impact:** Cannot use for autonomous research, but perfect for code analysis  
**Status:** Documented, no fix needed  
**Details:** See `01-scope-gaps-identified.md`

## 🔴 BLOCKERS - Must Fix Before Proceeding

### Blocker #1: Fix Native Web Search
**What:** chat_EXAI-WS with use_websearch=true must perform actual web browsing  
**Why:** Need to verify all information from current sources  
**How:** Debug tool schema injection in chat tool  
**Files:** `tools/chat.py`, `src/providers/capabilities.py`, `src/providers/glm_chat.py`  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Blocks all research

### Blocker #2: Redo Research with Correct Tools
**What:** Comprehensive research on zai-sdk for international users  
**Why:** Previous research has inaccuracies  
**How:** Use working web-search tools or fixed EXAI tools  
**Dependencies:** Blocker #1 (or use Augment web-search as workaround)  
**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks implementation planning

### Blocker #3: Rewrite Implementation Plan
**What:** Update document 03 with corrected information  
**Why:** Current plan based on incorrect research  
**How:** Use corrected research from Blocker #2  
**Dependencies:** Blocker #2  
**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks implementation

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Fix Native Web Search (CRITICAL)
**Owner:** Development team  
**Timeline:** ASAP  
**Tasks:**
1. Debug chat tool's web_search tool injection
2. Verify GLMCapabilities.get_websearch_tool_schema() is called
3. Test with glm_payload_preview to inspect payload
4. Ensure web_search tool reaches GLM API
5. Test with actual web search queries
6. Document working configuration

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `chat_EXAI-WS(prompt="...", use_websearch=true)` performs actual web search
- Results include current information with sources
- No manual intervention required

### Step 2: Conduct Comprehensive Research
**Owner:** Agent with working tools  
**Timeline:** After Step 1 OR use Augment tools  
**Tasks:**
1. Research latest zai-sdk version and features
