# Wave 1 Model Selection Corrections

**Document Type:** Change Summary  
**Status:** Complete  
**Created:** 2025-10-02  
**Purpose:** Document corrections made to Wave 1 documentation for accurate Kimi model selection

---

## Executive Summary

During Wave 1 Phase 1 execution, it was discovered that all Wave 1 documentation incorrectly referenced `kimi-latest` as the default/recommended Kimi model. After comprehensive research of Moonshot AI's official documentation, all references have been corrected to use `kimi-k2-0905-preview` (version-pinned K2 model).

**Total Changes:** 13 occurrences across 4 files + 1 new guide created

## Research Findings

### Official Moonshot Documentation

**Sources:**
- platform.moonshot.ai/docs/guide/choose-an-appropriate-kimi-model
- platform.moonshot.ai/docs/guide/agent-support
- Multiple technical articles and model comparisons

### Key Discoveries

**1. Model Generations:**
- **K1:** Original generation (legacy)
- **K1.5:** Multimodal reasoning (January 2025)
- **K2:** Agentic Intelligence (July 2025, updated September 2025)

**2. K2 Specifications:**
- **Architecture:** 1T total parameters, 32B active (MoE)
- **Context Window:** 256K tokens (largest available)
- **Pricing:** $0.60/M input, $2.50/M output
- **Capabilities:** Specifically tuned for tool use, coding, multi-step instructions
- **Performance:** SOTA on SWE Bench Verified, Tau2, AceBench

**3. K2 Versions:**
- `kimi-k2-0711-preview` (July 11, 2025 - original K2)
- `kimi-k2-0905-preview` (September 5, 2025 - enhanced coding & tool-calling) **[LATEST]**

**4. kimi-latest vs Version Pinning:**
- `kimi-latest` is an alias that may auto-update
- Version pinning (k2-0905-preview) ensures stability
- **Production systems should use version-pinned models**

**5. Official Recommendation:**
> "Model Selection: If response speed is not a high priority, you can choose to use the kimi-k2-0905-preview or kimi-k2-0711-preview model, which..."

**Interpretation:** K2 models trade speed for better capabilities (tool use, coding, reasoning)
