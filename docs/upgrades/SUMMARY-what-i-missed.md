# Summary: What I Missed - GLM & Z.ai Research

**Date:** 2025-10-01  
**Research Method:** Native Web Search via GLM-4.5 (as requested)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Major corrections identified and documented

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

You were absolutely right to ask me to investigate again. I found **MAJOR INACCURACIES** in my previous documentation that would have caused significant issues during implementation.

### The Big Mistakes:

1. **Wrong SDK Understanding** - I didn't realize there are TWO separate SDK packages
2. **Wrong Release Date** - GLM-4.6 was released TODAY (Sept 30, 2025), not in July
3. **Wrong Context Length** - GLM-4.6 has 200K context, not 128K
4. **Missing Features** - I completely missed video generation, assistant API, and character role-playing

## üö® Critical Error #1: Dual SDK Packages

### What I Documented (WRONG):
```
Package: zai-sdk
Version: 0.0.4
```

### What's Actually True (CORRECT):
There are **TWO SEPARATE SDK PACKAGES**:

#### 1. `zhipuai` - For Mainland China Users
- **Latest Version:** `2.1.5.20250825` (August 25, 2025)
- **PyPI:** https://pypi.org/project/zhipuai/
- **Base URL:** `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4/`
- **Client Class:** `ZhipuAI`
- **Platform:** https://open.bigmodel.cn/

```python
from zhipuai import ZhipuAI
client = ZhipuAI(api_key="your-key")
```

#### 2. `zai-sdk` - For Overseas Users
- **Latest Version:** `0.0.4` (September 30, 2025)
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/THUDM/z-ai-sdk-python
- **Base URL:** `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/`
- **Client Classes:** `ZaiClient`, `ZhipuAiClient`
- **Platform:** https://z.ai/

```python
from zai import ZaiClient
client = ZaiClient(api_key="your-key")
```

### Why This Matters:
- Our codebase uses `zai-sdk>=0.0.3.3` which is correct for overseas users
- But I never documented that there are TWO packages
- Users in China would need `zhipuai` instead
- The version numbers are completely different (2.1.5 vs 0.0.4)

## üö® Critical Error #2: GLM-4.6 Release Date

### What I Implied (WRONG):
- GLM-4.6 was released around July 2025 with GLM-4.5

### What's Actually True (CORRECT):
- **GLM-4.5** released: **July 28, 2025**
- **GLM-4.6** released: **September 30, 2025** (TODAY!)

**Source:** https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.6

### Why This Matters:
- GLM-4.6 is BRAND NEW (literally released today)
- It's not an older model, it's the latest flagship
- My documentation made it seem like it was released months ago

---

## üö® Critical Error #3: GLM-4.6 Context Length

### What I Documented (WRONG):
- Context: 128K tokens (same as GLM-4.5)

### What's Actually True (CORRECT):
- **GLM-4.5:** 128K tokens
- **GLM-4.6:** **200K tokens** (56% increase!)

### Why This Matters:
- This is a MAJOR upgrade (128K ‚Üí 200K)
- Enables much longer conversations and documents
- Critical for agentic workflows
- I completely missed this key improvement

---

## üö® Critical Error #4: Missing Features

### What I Didn't Document:

#### 1. Video Generation (CogVideoX-2)
```python
response = client.videos.generations(
    model="cogvideox-2",
    prompt="A cat playing with a ball",
    quality="quality",  # or "speed"
    with_audio=True,
    size="1920x1080",  # Up to 4K: "3840x2160"
    fps=30,  # or 60
)
```

**Features:**
- Text-to-video generation
- Image-to-video generation
- Up to 4K resolution (3840x2160)
- 30 or 60 FPS
- Optional audio generation

#### 2. Assistant API
```python
response = client.assistant.conversation(
    assistant_id="your_assistant_id",
    model="glm-4-assistant",
    messages=[...],
    stream=True,
)
```

**Features:**
- Structured conversation management
- Streaming support
- Metadata and attachments
- User and request ID tracking

#### 3. Character Role-Playing (CharGLM-3)
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="charglm-3",
    messages=[...],
    meta={
        "user_info": "I am a film director...",
        "bot_info": "You are a popular singer...",
        "bot_name": "Alice",
        "user_name": "Director",
    },
)
```

**Features:**
- Character-based conversations
- Persona customization
- Role-playing scenarios

### Why This Matters:
- These are MAJOR features I completely missed
- Video generation is a huge capability
- Assistant API is critical for structured workflows
- Character RP opens new use cases

## ‚úÖ What I Got Right

To be fair, I did get some things correct:

1. ‚úÖ GLM-4.5 specifications (355B total, 32B active)
2. ‚úÖ GLM-4.5-flash and GLM-4.5-air variants
3. ‚úÖ Web search tool integration
4. ‚úÖ Streaming support
5. ‚úÖ Function calling capabilities
6. ‚úÖ Multimodal (vision) support with GLM-4.5V
7. ‚úÖ Base API URL structure
8. ‚úÖ `zai-sdk` version 0.0.4 (though I missed the dual-SDK situation)

## üí° Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong:
1. **Didn't verify with web search** - I relied on training data instead of current sources
2. **Didn't check PyPI** - I assumed package names without verification
3. **Didn't read release notes** - I missed the actual release dates
4. **Didn't explore full API** - I missed major features like video generation

### What Went Right:
1. **You caught it** - You knew something was wrong and asked me to investigate
2. **Used native web search** - GLM-4.5 web browsing found the correct information
3. **Verified multiple sources** - PyPI, GitHub, official blog, documentation
4. **Documented everything** - Created comprehensive correction documents

### How to Prevent This:
1. **Always use web search** for current information
2. **Always verify package names** on PyPI
3. **Always check official sources** (blogs, docs, GitHub)
4. **Always test assumptions** with actual API calls

## üéâ Conclusion

**You were 100% right to ask me to investigate again.**

I made significant errors in my initial research that would have caused problems during implementation. By using GLM's native web search (as you requested), I was able to find the correct, current information and document all the mistakes.

The most critical findings:
1. **Dual SDK packages** - zhipuai (China) vs zai-sdk (Overseas)
2. **GLM-4.6 is brand new** - Released TODAY (Sept 30, 2025)
3. **200K context** - Not 128K as I documented
4. **Major missing features** - Video generation, Assistant API, Character RP

All corrections have been documented and pushed to GitHub. The next step is to rewrite the original markdown files with the correct information.

**Research Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Corrections Documented:** ‚úÖ YES  
**Pushed to GitHub:** ‚úÖ YES  
**Ready for Implementation:** ‚è≥ PENDING (need to rewrite original docs)
