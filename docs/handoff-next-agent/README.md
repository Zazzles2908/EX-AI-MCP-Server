**Previous Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Augment Agent)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ READY FOR HANDOFF

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Read These Files (In Order)

1. **SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-01-08.md** (10 min read)
   - What was done this session
   - Current system state
   - What's ready for you

2. **INVESTIGATION_FINDINGS.md** (15 min read)
   - Critical findings that need attention
   - Assumptions that need validation
   - Proposed cleanup actions

3. **docs/architecture/README.md** (5 min read)
   - Architecture overview
   - Where to find documentation

---

## üìã Your Mission (Choose One)

### Option A: Quick Cleanup (4-8 hours) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Goal:** Fix 3 critical placeholder issues

**Tasks:**
1. Investigate `hybrid_platform_manager.py` - is it used?
2. Fix `check_client_filters()` stub function
3. Document GLM embeddings limitation

**Why Recommended:**
- Addresses most critical findings
- Low risk, high value
- Can complete in one session

**Start Here:** `INVESTIGATION_FINDINGS.md` ‚Üí Critical Findings section

---

### Option B: Comprehensive Validation (24-36 hours)

**Goal:** Validate all assumptions from previous session

**Tasks:**
1. Deep-dive all 29 tool implementations
2. Validate request handler pipeline
3. Test provider fallback behavior
4. Update all documentation

**Why Consider:**
- Complete understanding of system
- All assumptions validated
- Thorough cleanup

**Start Here:** `INVESTIGATION_FINDINGS.md` ‚Üí Proposed Investigation Plan

---

### Option C: Merge and Move On (2-4 hours)

**Goal:** Ship current work, address issues later

**Tasks:**
1. Run automated tests
2. Fix any test failures
3. Merge to main
4. Tag as v2.0.2

**Why Consider:**
- Current work is solid
- Placeholders are minor
- Can address later

**Start Here:** Run tests, then merge

---

## üîç Critical Findings Summary

### Finding 1: Placeholder SDK Clients ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **File:** `src/providers/hybrid_platform_manager.py:33`
- **Issue:** SDK clients set to None (placeholder)
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - file may be unused
- **Action:** Investigate usage, remove if unused

### Finding 2: Stub Filter Function ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **File:** `src/server/handlers/request_handler_routing.py:83`
- **Issue:** Function always returns None (no filtering)
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - misleading function name
- **Action:** Implement or remove

### Finding 3: GLM Embeddings Not Implemented ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **File:** `src/embeddings/provider.py:87`
- **Issue:** Raises NotImplementedError
- **Impact:** LOW - system works without it
- **Action:** Document limitation

---

## üìö Key Documentation

### Must Read
- `docs/architecture/README.md` - Architecture overview
- `docs/architecture/core-systems/backbone-xray/README.md` - System foundation
- `docs/handoff-next-agent/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-01-08.md` - What was done
- `docs/handoff-next-agent/INVESTIGATION_FINDINGS.md` - What needs attention

### Reference
- `docs/architecture/releases/` - Version-specific docs
- `docs/architecture/core-systems/backbone-xray/` - Deep-dive analysis
- `docs/architecture/core-systems/backbone-xray/ENV_FORENSICS.md` - Why flags are false

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Available

### Analysis Tools
- `backbone_tracer.py` - Python AST-based import analysis
- `trace-component.ps1` - PowerShell pattern matching

### Usage
```bash
# Analyze any component
python backbone_tracer.py singletons
python backbone_tracer.py providers
python backbone_tracer.py request_handler

# PowerShell version
powershell -File trace-component.ps1 singletons
```

---

## ‚úÖ System Health Checks

### Before You Start
```bash
# Identity check (must be True)
python -c "from server import TOOLS; from src.daemon.ws_server import SERVER_TOOLS; print('SAME OBJECT:', TOOLS is SERVER_TOOLS)"

# Tool count (should be 29)
python -c "from server import TOOLS; print('Tool count:', len(TOOLS))"

# Server status
powershell -Command "Get-Content logs/ws_daemon.health.json | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object tool_count,uptime_human"
```

### After Your Changes
```bash
# Run same checks above
# All should still pass

# Run automated tests (if available)
python -m pytest tests/

# Restart server
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ws_start.ps1 -Restart
```

---

## üìù Task Management

### Update Tasks
```python
# Mark current task in progress
update_tasks([{"task_id": "...", "state": "IN_PROGRESS"}])

# Mark task complete
update_tasks([{"task_id": "...", "state": "COMPLETE"}])

# Add new tasks
add_tasks([{"name": "...", "description": "...", "state": "NOT_STARTED"}])
```

- ‚ùå Skip forensic checks after changes
- ‚ùå Merge to main without user approval
- ‚ùå Delete files without investigating usage

### DO
- ‚úÖ Read documentation before making changes
- ‚úÖ Run forensic checks after every change
- ‚úÖ Update task list with progress
- ‚úÖ Document all findings
- ‚úÖ Ask user for clarification when unsure

- [ ] Run system health checks
- [ ] Choose approach (A, B, or C)
- [ ] Get user approval

### During Work
- [ ] Update task list regularly
- [ ] Run forensic checks after changes
- [ ] Document findings as you go
- [ ] Keep commits clean and descriptive

### Before Finishing
- [ ] Run all health checks
- [ ] Update documentation

## üìû Questions?

If you're unsure about anything:
1. Check the documentation first
2. Review previous agent's findings
3. Ask the user for clarification
4. Document your decision

---

## üéì Context You Have

### High-Level Understanding ‚úÖ
- System architecture (3 core subsystems)
- Entry points and bootstrap flow
- Provider abstraction layer
- Request processing pipeline
- Import relationships and call graphs

### What You DON'T Have ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Individual tool implementations
- Provider internals (Kimi, GLM specific)
- Utility module details
- Function-level dead code analysis

**This is intentional** - previous agent focused on top-down view. You can dive deeper as needed.

## üö¶ Current Branch

**Branch:** `refactor/orchestrator-sync-v2.0.2`  
**Status:** All changes committed and pushed  
**Ready for:** Continue work or merge to main

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Start Small** - Don't try to do everything at once
2. **Verify Often** - Run forensic checks frequently
3. **Document Everything** - Future you will thank you
4. **Ask Questions** - User is available for clarification
5. **Stay Focused** - Pick one option and stick with it
