## Top-line (YES/NO)
YES — We have a clear picture of failure modes and a pragmatic path to eliminate hangs/cancellations via dispatcher-level fallback, provider-specific fixes, and modularization.

## Scope and Evidence Sources
- EXAI‑WS daemon: ws://127.0.0.1:8765 (22 tools loaded; activity logging enabled)
- Backend MCP runner telemetry (real-time status + JSONL artifacts)
- Kimi analysis artifacts: docs/augment_reports/augment_review_02/kimi_analysis/runs/
- Code review of key components:
  - server.py (dispatcher + watchdog)
  - tools/providers/kimi/kimi_upload.py, kimi_tools_chat.py
  - tools/providers/glm/glm_files.py
  - src/providers/kimi.py (OpenAI-compatible wrapper)
  - src/providers/registry.py (routing)

## Executive Summary of Issues
- Reproducible early cancellations in Kimi multi-file chat shortly after successful uploads.
- Missing, system-wide fallback orchestration: isolated local fallback exists only for one path.
- server.py is monolithic; cross-cutting concerns (timeouts, retries, fallback, circuit breakers) are intertwined and fragile.
- Error envelopes vary by tool; not standardized for dispatcher to act on.
- Observability is good at the runner level but incomplete at the server dispatcher (per-attempt annotations and circuit-breaker state are missing).

## Error Inventory (by layer)

### 1) Provider/Tool Layer
- Kimi multi-file chat cancellations (~5s post-upload) [Observed]:
  - Symptoms: Uploads succeed; chat call cancels quickly; user sees no content.
  - Potential causes (not mutually exclusive):
    1. Message construction: injecting full extracted text as system messages may exceed internal provider heuristics, leading to quick cancellation.
    2. API semantics: Moonshot file-based QA patterns may prefer attaching file ids or using specific arguments over raw content injection; current code uses files.content().text then constructs messages.
    3. Missing headers/flow: Idempotency/trace headers are present, but lack of explicit tool_call semantics or required fields for some models could trigger early abort.
    4. Timeout/cancel mapping: Provider may return a “cancelled” status on internal validation error; our wrapper surfaces this as cancellation.
- Kimi chat-with-tools:
  - Has per-call timeouts but no cross-provider fallback and limited structured error signals.
- GLM multi-file chat:
  - Works via upload + system preamble (no content fetch); lacks standardized error envelopes.

### 2) Dispatcher (server.py)
- Single large module handling: routing, watchdog, tool invocation, partial telemetry.
- No centralized fallback orchestrator or circuit breaker; failures bubble up as user-visible errors/hangs.
- Watchdog heartbeats present, but not tied to per-attempt fallback transitions.

### 3) Client/UI Visibility Path
- Known “missing outputs” symptom: raw frames differ from UI; requires consistent envelope mapping and progress mirroring for all tools.

## Root Cause Analysis: Kimi multi_file_chat cancellations
- Most plausible primary cause: Message construction strategy (large extracted text as system messages) combined with provider-side validation limits or content heuristics. Rapid post-upload cancellation suggests chat request is being rejected early server-side (not a long-running timeout).
- Contributing factors:
  - No local retry/backoff around the chat call (only uploads use retry for content fetch); any transient throttling triggers immediate failure.
  - No dispatcher-level fallback; user sees failure instead of automatic degradation to GLM or analytic summarization.
  - Lack of standardized structured error envelope prevents the server from recognizing recoverable failures.

## Provider-specific Issues
- Kimi/Moonshot:
  - OpenAI-compatible client usage is generally correct; however, Moonshot docs (tool-calls, multi-turn, file-based QA, context caching) imply richer patterns:
    - Prefer file-id attachment or provider-native context-caching over injecting raw extracted text into system messages when available.
    - Ensure tool_call semantics (when used) match Moonshot’s expected schema.
    - Confirm model selection against SUPPORTED_MODELS and doc examples (k2 preview vs v1 series) for file QA.
- GLM (ZhipuAI):
  - Current integration is via OpenAI-like abstractions; migration to native SDK (zai-sdk) is recommended for file handling, web search, and agent APIs.

## Server Architecture Fragility Points (server.py)
- Monolithic 2600+ lines; tangled concerns (routing, timeouts, logging, execution, tool schema exposure).
- Limited seams for injecting fallback chains and circuit breakers.
- Harder to unit-test in isolation (stateful behaviors and timers intermixed).

## Tool-level Error Patterns and Missing Fallbacks
- Inconsistent error responses (strings vs dict vs envelopes) complicate orchestration.
- Stream vs non-stream paths diverge in behavior and error surfacing.
- Only one partial fallback path implemented; others return terminal errors on timeout.

## Observability Gaps
- Dispatcher lacks per-attempt JSONL breadcrumbs (attempt index, tool, provider, duration, reason, next action).
- Circuit-breaker status not recorded or exposed.
- UI mapping: not all tool responses include standardized fields that the client can reliably render.

## Immediate Mitigations
- Add dispatcher-level fallback orchestrator for file_chat capability (Kimi → GLM → Analyze+files → Chat), with standardized error envelopes.
- Harden KimiMultiFileChatTool: per-call timeout, 1 retry with backoff, and structured error payloads.
- Add circuit breakers per provider/model with short cool-offs to avoid thrash.

## Validation Strategy (short-term)
- Re-run backend MCP runner with unpredictable prompts; confirm:
  - No hangs; timeouts transform into fallbacks.
  - Artifacts include attempt-by-attempt logs.
  - UI receives final answer with a brief fallback notice in metadata.

## Long-term Fixes (tie-in to roadmap)
- Adopt Moonshot’s file-based QA and context-caching patterns directly (attach file ids or use provider-native context caching).
- Migrate GLM flows to native SDK and feature-specific endpoints (files, agents, web search) for robustness.
- Modularize server into orchestrator + modules (fallback, circuit, dispatcher, telemetry) with unit tests around each.
