MCP Tool Schema for Smart File Download

This schema defines the smart_file_download tool for the MCP protocol,
making it visible and usable by external agents (Claude, other AI assistants).

The tool provides seamless file download capabilities with automatic caching,
integrity verification, and provider fallback.

        "SEAMLESS FILE DOWNLOAD - Download files from AI providers with automatic caching and integrity verification.\n\n"
        "üéØ USE THIS FOR:\n"
        "- Download AI-generated files (code, documents, images)\n"
        "- Retrieve previously uploaded files from Kimi/Moonshot\n"
        "- Download files with automatic integrity verification\n"
        "- Batch download multiple files\n\n"
        "‚ö° INTELLIGENT FEATURES:\n"
        "- Cache-first strategy: Local cache ‚Üí Kimi API ‚Üí Supabase Storage (automatic fallback)\n"
        "- SHA256 integrity verification on all downloads (detects corruption)\n"
        "- Provider auto-detection (automatically determines Kimi vs Supabase)\n"
        "- Concurrent download protection (prevents duplicate downloads of same file)\n"
        "- Download tracking (records download history, performance metrics, analytics)\n"
        "- Error handling with automatic retry (exponential backoff, max 3 attempts)\n"
        "- Size-based cache expiry: Small files (14 days), Medium (7 days), Large (3 days)\n\n"
        "üîå PROVIDER SUPPORT:\n"
        "- ‚úÖ Kimi/Moonshot: Full support (persistent files, 30+ days retention)\n"
        "- ‚úÖ Supabase: Full support (permanent storage)\n"
        "- ‚ùå GLM/Z.ai: NOT SUPPORTED (files are session-bound only, cannot be downloaded)\n\n"
        "üìÅ FILE PATHS:\n"
        "- All downloads MUST be within /mnt/project/ directory\n"
        "- Default destination: /mnt/project/downloads/\n"
        "- Accessible paths: /mnt/project/EX-AI-MCP-Server/*, /mnt/project/Personal_AI_Agent/*\n\n"
        "üîí SECURITY:\n"
        "- Automatic SHA256 hash verification\n"
        "- Path validation (prevents directory traversal)\n"
        "- Corrupted files automatically deleted\n\n"
        "üí° USAGE EXAMPLES:\n"
        "1. Simple download: smart_file_download(file_id='file_abc123')\n"
        "2. Custom destination: smart_file_download(file_id='file_abc123', destination='/mnt/project/scripts/')\n"
        "3. Batch download: [smart_file_download(file_id=id) for id in file_ids]\n\n"
        "‚ö†Ô∏è LIMITATIONS & ERROR HANDLING:\n"
        "- GLM/Z.ai files CANNOT be downloaded (session-bound only, no download API)\n"
        "- Network timeouts: Automatic retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)\n"
        "- Provider failures: Automatic fallback to Supabase storage\n"
        "- Corrupted files: Automatically detected and re-downloaded\n"
        "- Invalid file_id: Validated before attempting download\n\n"
        "üìä PERFORMANCE:\n"
        "- Small files (<10MB): <2 seconds (cache hit: <0.1s)\n"
        "- Medium files (10-100MB): <30 seconds (cache hit: <0.5s)\n"
        "- Large files (>100MB): <5 minutes (cache hit: <2s)\n"
        "- Cache hit rate: Typically >80% for frequently accessed files\n\n"
        "Perfect for: downloading AI-generated content, retrieving uploaded files, batch downloads, file backup operations, cross-session file access."
