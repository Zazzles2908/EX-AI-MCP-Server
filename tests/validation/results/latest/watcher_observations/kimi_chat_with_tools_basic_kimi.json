    "observations": "The tool correctly handled an empty input by returning a clear error message. However, the test status of 'passed' might be misleading as it suggests success when an error was returned.",
    "progress": "Improved from previous run (Run #3) with better error handling and determinable correctness, but introduced some test status confusion.",
