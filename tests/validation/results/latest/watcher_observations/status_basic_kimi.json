      "The content field contains an incomplete JSON string that appears to be cut off mid-way through listing models",

      "Ensure complete JSON responses without truncation to provide full information to consumers",

    "confidence": 0.9,
    "observations": "The test passed, indicating basic functionality of the status tool works. However, the response has formatting issues with an incomplete JSON string and a potentially misleading 'outputs_count' field. Performance metrics were not collected, limiting the ability to fully evaluate the tool's efficiency.",
    "progress": "No improvement from the previous run. The same issues persist, indicating that the suggested improvements have not been implemented.",
