    "observations": "The selfcheck tool continues to pass basic functionality tests but lacks comprehensive validation. Performance metrics are still not being captured, which limits the ability to assess resource efficiency.",
    "progress": "No improvements or regressions from the previous run. The same issues persist: empty input, no performance metrics, and limited test coverage. The tool's behavior is consistent with the previous run, indicating stability but also stagnation in testing improvements.",
