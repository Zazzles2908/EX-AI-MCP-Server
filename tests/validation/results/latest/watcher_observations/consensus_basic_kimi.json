    "anomalies": [
      "Content is truncated (model_response field ends with 'glm-4' instead of complete information)",
      "Empty JSON input {} still causes issues without proper error handling",

      "Fix the truncation issue in the response content to ensure complete model responses",

    "confidence": 0.9,
    "observations": "The tool continues to report success while providing incomplete responses. Empty inputs continue to cause issues without proper error handling, and the content truncation problem persists and appears to have worsened from the previous run.",
    "progress": "Regression from previous run. Quality score decreased from 4/10 to 3/10. The content truncation issue appears worse (now affecting the actual response content rather than just error messages), and the same issues with empty JSON inputs persist.",
