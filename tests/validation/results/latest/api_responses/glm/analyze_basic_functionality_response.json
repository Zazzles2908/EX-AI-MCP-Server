        "content": "Here's a comprehensive test prompt designed to evaluate analytical capabilities across multiple dimensions. This prompt can be adapted for various domains (e.g., literature, business, data, policy):\n\n---\n\n### Test Prompt: Analytical Evaluation  \n**Role:** You are a senior analyst with expertise in critical thinking, pattern recognition, and evidence-based reasoning.  \n\n**Task:** Analyze the provided text using the following framework. Structure your response in the numbered sections below.  \n\n**Text to Analyze:**  \n> *\"The rapid adoption of AI in healthcare promises revolutionary diagnostics but introduces significant ethical dilemmas. While algorithms can detect diseases earlier than humans, they may inherit biases from training data, leading to misdiagnosis in underrepresented populations. Additionally, data privacy concerns arise as patient information becomes central to AI development. Proponents argue that regulatory frameworks can mitigate these risks, but critics contend that innovation may be stifled by excessive oversight.\"*  \n\n---\n\n### Required Analysis Structure:  \n1. **Core Argument Identification**  \n   - What is the central thesis?  \n   - Identify 2–3 key claims supporting the thesis.  \n\n2. **Evidence Assessment**  \n   - Evaluate the strength of evidence provided for each key claim.  \n   - Note any missing data or logical gaps.  \n\n3. **Stakeholder Perspectives**  \n   - List 3 distinct stakeholder groups (e.g., patients, developers, regulators).  \n   - For each group, summarize their likely position and underlying interests.  \n\n4. **Bias & Assumptions**  \n   - Identify 2 implicit assumptions in the text.  \n   - Highlight 1 potential bias (e.g., technological optimism, regulatory skepticism).  \n\n5. **Counterarguments**  \n   - Propose 1 significant counterargument not mentioned in the text.  \n   - Explain how it challenges the original thesis.  \n\n6. **Ethical Implications**  \n   - Rank the top 3 ethical concerns (e.g., equity, privacy, autonomy) by urgency.  \n   - Justify your ranking.  \n\n7. **Actionable Recommendations**  \n   - Suggest 2 evidence-based solutions to address the primary tension (innovation vs. ethics).  \n   - Specify measurable outcomes for each solution.  \n\n---\n\n### Evaluation Criteria:  \n- **Depth:** Demonstrate nuanced understanding beyond surface-level claims.  \n- **Objectivity:** Balance multiple perspectives without favoring one side.  \n- **Clarity:** Use precise terminology and logical structure.  \n- **Creativity:** Integrate external knowledge (e.g., real-world examples, academic concepts).  \n- **Feasibility:** Ensure recommendations are contextually realistic.  \n\n---\n\n### Example Response Snippet (for guidance):  \n> **1. Core Argument Identification**  \n> - Central Thesis: AI in healthcare presents a trade-off between diagnostic innovation and ethical risks.  \n> - Key Claims:  \n>   - AI improves diagnostic accuracy but inherits training data biases.  \n>   - Data privacy conflicts with AI development needs.  \n>   - Regulation may balance risks but could hinder innovation.  \n\n> **4. Bias & Assumptions**  \n> - Assumption: Technological progress inherently justifies AI adoption in healthcare.  \n> - Bias: Overemphasis on innovation benefits underplaying equity concerns.  \n\n---\n\n### Usage Notes:  \n- **For AI Testing:** Use this prompt to evaluate how well a model handles complex, multi-layered analysis.  \n- **For Human Testing:** Assign a time limit (e.g., 30 minutes) to assess critical thinking under pressure.  \n- **Customization:** Replace the sample text with domain-specific content (e.g., financial reports, literary passages, scientific abstracts).  \n\nThis prompt tests analytical rigor, ethical reasoning, and structured communication—key skills for data-driven decision-making.",
        "reasoning_content": "\nWe are going to create a test prompt for an analysis task.\n The goal is to have a model analyze a given text and provide insights.\n We'll design a prompt that asks the model to analyze a passage and answer specific questions about it.\n\n Example prompt structure:\n\n \"You are an expert analyst. Your task is to analyze the following text and answer the questions that follow.\n\n Text: [Insert text here]\n\n Questions:\n 1. What is the main argument of the text?\n 2. Identify the key points supporting the main argument.\n 3. What evidence is provided to support these key points?\n 4. Are there any logical fallacies or weaknesses in the argument?\n 5. What is the overall tone of the text? Provide examples.\n\n Please provide your analysis in a structured format, using bullet points for each question.\"\n\n However, note that the user's request is very brief: \"Test prompt for analyze\". \n We are to create a test prompt, so we can choose a sample text and then ask for analysis.\n\n Let's create a sample text and then the prompt.\n\n Sample text (about a topic, say, the benefits of remote work):\n\n \"Remote work has become increasingly popular in recent years, especially after the global pandemic. Proponents argue that it offers numerous benefits, including increased flexibility for employees, reduced commuting time and costs, and a better work-life balance. Additionally, companies can save on office space and utilities. However, critics point out that remote work can lead to feelings of isolation among employees, challenges in team collaboration, and difficulties in maintaining company culture. Despite these concerns, many organizations are adopting hybrid models to combine the best of both worlds.\"\n\n Now, we can create the prompt with this text and the questions.\n\n But note: the user might want a general prompt that can be used for any text. \n Alternatively, we can create a prompt that includes the text and the questions.\n\n Since the request is for a \"test prompt\", we can create one that is self-contained.\n\n Let me write the full prompt:",
