So we are counting words.\n\n Alternatively, we can use: \"Hello, good to see you.\" -> \n      Hello (1), good (2), to (3), see (4), you (5) -> 5 words.\n\n But let's stick to the first one because it's a common greeting.\n\n However, the instruction does not specify the language. Since the user wrote in English, we'll use English.\n\n Final answer: \"Hello, how are you today?\"",
