        "content": "**Challenge Prompt: The Memory Thief**  \n*Genre: Sci-Fi / Psychological Thriller*  \n\n**Scenario:**  \nIn 2097, memories are currency. A black-market technology allows people to extract, sell, and implant experiences into others’ minds. You wake up in a sterile room with a splitting headache, a scar behind your ear, and a note in your handwriting: *“You agreed to this. Don’t trust your memories—they’re not yours anymore. Find Subject 42 before they find you.”*  \n\n**Constraints:**  \n1. The protagonist’s **original identity** must remain ambiguous until the final paragraph.  \n2. Every **implanted memory** they encounter contains **one deliberate lie** that contradicts a sensory detail (e.g., a memory of rain that feels warm).  \n3. The **antagonist** is a **child** who claims to be the protagonist’s **future self**, aged via memory acceleration.  \n4. The story must include the line: *“The scar isn’t from the surgery—it’s where I tried to cut you out of me.”*  \n5. End with a **choice**: retain their last real memory (which will kill them in 24 hours) or implant a fake one that erases their guilt but makes them the next Memory Thief.  \n\n**Twist Requirement:**  \nThe **reader** must realize the protagonist **wrote the note to themselves**—but the **handwriting isn’t theirs**.  \n\nGo."
